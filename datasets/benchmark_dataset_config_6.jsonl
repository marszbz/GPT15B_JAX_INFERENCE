While it is important to contribute effort to these things to keep the system functioning, it is necessary to set a limit, so that they don't take over the fun of doing science itself. The system will not collapse just because one says “no” from time to time in order to preserve time to do science. Learning to say “no” is particularly important for young faculty, who find themselves barraged with such requests, and who can easily get sucked into full-time committee duties. It is wise to step back frequently and ask, “overall, is this work I am doing fun?” If the answer is no, perhaps it is time to revisit points 1 and 4 above, and consider diving into a new area.\n\n6. Learn to enjoy the process of writing and presenting. Note the distinction in this guideline from: “learn to write and present well.” Many students I encounter dislike writing more than anything else they do. As a result, when it comes time to write a paper, it is a struggle from start to finish, both for them and for those working with them. When one doesn't like doing something, procrastination is the most common response. Procrastination and good writing don't mix. I say this even though I am someone who, as an undergraduate, would work all night on a term paper to turn it in at the last moment, and often receive an “A”. But in the real world of scientific paper writing, that first draft just won't cut it. It usually takes three or more significant rewritings and lots of input from others to get it right. Combine that with procrastination and it's a recipe for not getting a good paper out in a timely fashion, or perhaps not at all. So the key is to figure out how to enjoy the writing process, thereby encouraging oneself to avoid procrastination. There is no one formula that works for everyone—some people need utter peace and quiet for their writing. Others prefer writing at a coffee shop, or to have music playing. The thing is to figure out what works, and to stick with it, training oneself to have positive mental associations with writing. Robert Boice, in his book Advice for New Faculty Members, suggests the key is to do a little bit of writing every day [4]. The goal is simply get the ideas on the page, without worrying about their form at the beginning. By doing this a little bit every day—perhaps only 30–60 minutes—it is amazing how quickly and enjoyably a big writing project can take shape through a process of gradual evolution. This often takes significant retraining, however. Many of us begin with the notion that writing should come in sudden bursts of dramatic creation. This message is conveyed frequently in movies that portray an author writing a novel in a sudden last minute rush, and it is reinforced in high school and college by many of us learning to get away with writing papers at the last minute (and still doing well). Reprogramming that unrealistic expectation out of one's head is therefore a key to learning to enjoy writing. The same principle applies to giving a good presentation: enjoy its making and giving. Forget everything you ever learned about giving dry, stuffy presentations (i.e., all those things in the document How to Make a Scientific Lecture Unbearable) [5]. While it is critical to have good science in your talk, it is equally critical to bring that science to life for the audience. That is nigh impossible if you are scared to death of being in front of the audience, or if you are completely bored by your subject matter. If you are bored, the audience will surely be bored, and you might as well not have wasted their time—or your own. The last thing a reader or talk attendee wants to see is a bunch of data just to prove that you did some work. It is much more interesting to tell a story. The story begins with why you started the work in the first place (the big reasons, not just “because my advisor told me to”), it usually has mystery and intrigue (e.g., dead ends, which are worth reporting only if they helped lead you to the final answer), and some kind of dramatic conclusion (which challenges the audience to think about things in a new way). This may seem like overstatement, but having sat through many extraordinarily dry, boring scientific talks (and having read many dry papers), I find that the ones that stand out are those that have such elements. If there is a lack of enthusiasm for the work you are doing, that may be a sign that it's the wrong work for you to be doing. It can be a fun challenge to figure out who your audience is and what they will respond to.

{"id": "sample_6_2", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " group funded by the Koch brothers \"Freedom Partners\" conduit, is backing one of the Koch's favorite politicians and thanking him for his support for a Koch-approved ALEC model bill.\n\nThe Arlington, Virginia, astroturf group recently asked Wisconsinites to sign a petition thanking Governor Scott Walker for signing \"The CASE for Jobs Act.\" The tweets signal that the group is trying to capture names in Wisconsin perhaps for use in the election cycle. As CMD previously reported, the group has been spending big money in federal races for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe tweets from @GenOppWI went viral on Twitter, but not for the reasons the group would have hoped. Rather, Wisconsinites reacted viscerally to the call to thank Wisconsin's governor for making progress on jobs.\n\n\"@GenOppWI Is this a joke?\" was one of the milder and more common responses pouring into the Gen Opp account, prompting one Walker supporter to lament, \"I can't believe the negative replies.\"\n\nWisconsinites Aren't Buying Gen Opp Spin on Jobs\n\nGen Opp signaled its support for Walker by thanking him \"for giving our generation an opportunity to build our own future.\" How are Wisconsin youth building their future? Apparently by \"crowdfunding\" capital.\n\nJust a few months before the election, Gen Opp has begun peddling a petition to thank Walker for signing the CASE for Jobs Act, which he signed into law eight months ago. The bill in question was co-authored by Wisconsin ALEC members Rep. David Craig, Rep. Chad Weininger, and State Senator Leah Vukmir. Vukmir, an ALEC Board Member, was sued by the Center for Media and Democracy for failure to respond to our open records requests. The state attorney general settled the case with CMD in 2014, paying penalties and fees.\n\nDrafting documents obtained by CMD reveal that the CASE Act was modeled on a North Carolina bill, the \"Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act\" (JOBS Act). It, too, was introduced by a passel of ALEC politicians, including Kelly Hastings, Tom Murry, and Tim Moffitt. So it's not surprising that the bill then moved to ALEC and became ALEC's Local Investment Made Easy (LIME) Act, which was on the ALEC agenda in Kansas City in April 2014. It was approved as a \"model\" by ALEC's board, which includes Koch Industries, on July 1, 2014. Under the bill businesses are granted exemptions from state securities law and allowed to raise as much as $1 million from investors without an audited financial statement and up to $2 million with an audit (what could go wrong?). In case that was not worrisome enough, the Wisconsin version lowers the threshold to be an accredited investor. The Milwaukee Business Journal raised concerns that the changes would create risk for unsophisticated investors.\n\nAlthough the bill passed long ago, Gen Opp is trotting it out again to foster the notion that Walker is busy on the jobs front. In June 2014, CMD did an analysis that showed that the Wisconsin Economic Development Authority, Walker's flagship jobs agency which he chairs, had only created 5,800 jobs in the past three years. During the same period Wisconsin's WARN database indicates that 13,000 jobs were lost to plant closings and mass layoffs. Federal data puts Wisconsin in the 37th spot of all 50 states for new job creation and dead last among its Midwestern neighbors in job creation.\n\nBut the facts haven't stopped the Koch spin machine. Koch's American's for Prosperity Group recently spent nearly $900,000 on another round of TV ads sticking to their old mantra regarding the Walker agenda -- \"It's Working!\" after spending millions on the same message during Walker's 2012 recall election. And, a Koch-controlled foundation helped underwrite ALEC's \"Rich States, Poor States\" report which pumped up Wisconsin's purported economic grade despite the state's actually dismal economic performance. In 2010, Koch Industries PAC contributed $43,000 to Walker's campaign directly.\n\nWisconsinites who've had the misfortune of living through Walker's divisive and ineffective economic policies, were quick to respond to the Gen Opp spin with snark, facts and outrage, as can be seen below.\n\nBankrolled by Billionaires\n\nAs PR Watch reported earlier this month, Gen Opp launched a massive, nearly $2.3 million ad buy against Senators Kay Hagan (D-NC), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Mark Udall (D-CO) – all vulnerable Democrats in tough reelection fights that could determine the control of the U.S. Senate in the next session. Its support for Walker shows it will now be weighing into state races, too.\n\nWhere does Gen Opp get all this cash?\n\nIn 2012, Gen Opp received $5 million from Freedom Partners, a key part of the Koch political apparatus which raised some $256 million for the 2012 election cycle from deep pocketed donors", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

Here’s an idea for your next 26.\n\nIt’s called “Alphabet Dating,” and the concept has exploded on social media. The idea is that the couple (or serial daters) take turns planning normal dates using the order of the letters in the alphabet. Couples have been choosing dates and keeping it a secret from their partner until the big reveal.\n\nThe idea is to keep the spice on your relationship and have some fun with your partner. To the horror of men everywhere, “A” can be apple picking, while “B” can be a baseball game or a boat ride. “C” can be a simple coffee date. “D” can be a double date, and so on.\n\nHere are some couples who are going through the alphabet and coming up with some inventive date ideas.\n\nStarted Alphabet dating tonight, A is for Asian food,\" wrote one couple.\n\nStarted alphabet dating tonight 💖 A is for Asian food. 😍🍴 #alphabetdating #cheatmeal #slimmingworld A photo posted by 💜 laura (@_lauraeats) on Jul 16, 2016 at 3:16pm PDT\n\nThis couple played video games.\n\nV is for...

{"id": "sample_6_9", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " hotel and home, police say\n\nThe suspect in the Las Vegas shooting that has left at least 59 people dead had amassed an arsenal that included more than 40 firearms, police said on Monday night, as officials declared a state of emergency for the county encompassing the Las Vegas strip.\n\nAuthorities found 23 guns, including a handgun, in the hotel room of the gunman, identified earlier by police as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock. At least some were equipped with scopes, devices that help the shooter identify targets at a range, police said.\n\nNevada town where Vegas suspect lived catered to gamblers and gun lovers Read more\n\nThey also recovered 19 firearms plus explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition from Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada, a town near the border with Arizona, Joe Lombardo, the Las Vegas police sheriff, said. He also said police found “electronic devices” but would not describe them.\n\nSeveral pounds of ammonium nitrate, a material used to make explosives, were also found in Paddock’s car. Later on Monday, a Swat team searched a residence in northern Nevada believed to be associated with the gunman.\n\nAt an afternoon news conference, officials also updated the latest casualty figures, saying that at least 59 people were dead and 527 more injured. The gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the thousands of concertgoers attending the Route 91 country music festival on Sunday night.\n\nPlay Video 2:25 Who was Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock? – video\n\nIslamic State on Monday claimed that the gunman was “a soldier of the Islamic State”, but authorities have said that there was no evidence to substantiate that claim and that the group had falsified its role in attacks.\n\nThe shooting turned an American city known for its nightclubs and casinos into a war zone as thousands of concertgoers ran for cover from the bullets pouring down on them. The attack was the latest in a grim list of mass shootings, and the carnage surpassed the death toll at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, when 49 people were killed.\n\nThe first reports of the shooting came just after 10pm local time, as the country music star Jason Aldean, one of the festival’s final performers, played. As the bullets began to spray the crowd, Aldean stopped playing and ran off stage, prompting chaos in the crowd.\n\n“They’re thinking it’s fireworks or it’s part of the technology of the music being played. They were thinking it’s coming from different areas,” Carolyn Goodman, the mayor of Las Vegas, said at the press conference.\n\nAt least 527 people were injured – some were wounded by gunshots and shrapnel while others were trampled or hurt trying to jump fences and flee the site, police said.\n\nIn pursuit of the gunman, officers scoured the hotel floor by floor until arriving at Paddock’s suite, Lombardo said. Paddock engaged officers through his hotel room door, injuring a security guard in the leg, he said. The guard is expected to recover. Swat officers then broke down the door and swarmed the room, where they found Paddock dead.\n\n“We believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,” the sheriff told reporters.\n\nPlay Video 2:12 Las Vegas shooting: Donald Trump says 'it was an act of pure evil' – video\n\nIn Washington, Donald Trump called the attack an “act of pure evil”. He said he planned to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday and ordered the flags to be lowered to half-mast. In a response that has become a ritual, Democrats demanded lawmakers take action on gun control measures they believe will prevent – or at least reduce the number of casualties – of a future mass shooting, while Republicans blamed them for politicizing the moment.\n\n'This isn't supposed to happen here': hush falls over Las Vegas after shooting Read more\n\nIn Clark County, the coroner’s office worked to identify the victims and notify families, as residents wound around blocks to donate blood for the survivors. A number of evening vigils were planned around the city as donations and well-wishes poured in from around the country in support of the victims and their families.\n\nBy late Monday night, police said they still had no idea what motivated a retired accountant with no criminal history to carry out this attack.\n\nLombardo said Paddock appeared “reclusive” but cautioned that authorities were still combing through his background. The sheriff said it was possible that the gunman had attended a three-day music festival called Life is Beautiful in downtown Las Vegas one week ago.\n\nHe also said Marilou Danley, whom he described as Paddock’s girlfriend, was currently in Tokyo and that police intended to talk to her when she returns.\n\nA brother", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_6_10", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " United States involves billions of animals each year. The information we’ve seen suggests that these animals are often treated in ways that may cause extreme suffering over the course of their lives. What are possible interventions? Efforts to address the harms of industrial agriculture on animals typically focus on advocacy to individuals (to reduce their meat consumption), corporations (to reduce consumption or improve animal welfare conditions), or governments (to ban particular practices deemed especially harmful), though there are a number of other potential activities as well.\n\nEfforts to address the harms of industrial agriculture on animals typically focus on advocacy to individuals (to reduce their meat consumption), corporations (to reduce consumption or improve animal welfare conditions), or governments (to ban particular practices deemed especially harmful), though there are a number of other potential activities as well. Who else is working on it? Although the overall field of animal welfare receives a large amount of support from donors, relatively little funding appears to go to addressing the significant impacts of industrial agriculture on animal welfare.\n\nPublished: September 2013\n\nWhat is the problem?\n\nThere are over a billion animals in the United States being raised for food. Animal advocates report that the vast majority of them are raised on factory farms where they are treated in ways that may cause them extreme suffering. For example, of the 291 million egg-laying hens in the U.S., roughly 95% are raised in battery cages, which restrict motion and prevent hens from engaging in natural behaviors.\n\nWe have not yet vetted animal advocates’ claims about the extent to which industrial agriculture practices inflict harm upon chickens and other farm animals and how much they suffer as a result. Vetting these claims would be one of our top priorities were we to investigate this area further.\n\nWhat are possible interventions?\n\nMost work to advance farm animal welfare falls under the general rubric of advocacy, whether targeting individuals, corporations, or governments. Farm animal advocacy interventions we have heard about include:\n\nLegislative advocacy, lobbying, or ballot initiative campaigns to encourage state governments to ban particularly harmful practices.\n\nAdvertising to individuals to encourage them to reduce their meat consumption (e.g. by becoming vegetarian or vegan).\n\nMaintaining farm animal sanctuaries that are open to the public, to enable people to interact with farm animals with the intention of increasing empathy for them.\n\nOutreach to large institutions, such as school districts and hospitals to encourage the adoption of “Meatless Mondays” (to reduce overall meat consumption).\n\nPressuring large food sellers (e.g. fast food or grocery chains) and corporate animal producers to improve animal welfare practices in their supply chains.\n\nInvestigative reporting that exposes and raises the profile of abuses of animals in industrial agriculture.\n\nLitigation against corporations (to compel compliance with laws) or government agencies (to compel them to enforce laws).\n\nOutside the realm of advocacy, a funder may be able to support groups that evaluate the treatment of farm animals by different producers to enable consumers to make more informed choices with regards to animal welfare.\n\nWe do not have a strong sense of the likely costs or returns to any of these strategies.\n\nWho else is working on this?\n\nFor this investigation we focused on organizations based in the United States.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States, which has a budget of roughly $140 million/year, is the largest national animal welfare advocacy organization by a wide margin. However, its Farm Animal Protection team has only 11 staff members and an annual budget of around $1 million/year (though resources from other parts of the organization that are directed to improving farm animal welfare may raise the total allocation to 5-10% of the annual budget).\n\nA number of other large animal protection organizations do some work on farm animal welfare:\n\nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)\n\nAnimal Legal Defense Fund\n\nPETA\n\nHowever, none of these groups are primarily focused on farm animals, and we are unable to say with precision what portion of their budgets are directed towards efforts on farm animals.\n\nWe also heard about six considerably smaller advocacy organizations, with annual budgets in the approximate range from $500 thousand/year to $2 million/year, and Farm Sanctuary, which has a budget of ~$9 million/year but is not exclusively focused on advocacy.\n\nThe relatively small field of factory farming groups we heard about from advocates contrasted with our initial impression that animal issues tend to receive significant attention from a large number of advocacy groups. Our current understanding is that issues affecting stereotypically “cute” animals, such as cats and dogs, tend to receive disproportionate attention from most animal welfare advocates and donors, but that the treatment of animals in industrial agriculture may be relatively neglected.\n\nQuestions for further investigation\n\nOur research in this area has been relatively limited, and many important questions remain unanswered by our investigation.\n\nAmongst other topics", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_14", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " are not necessarily used together, but both are ways of getting cracks out from the immediate wall of the wellbore so that the valuable fluid on the other side can have an easier path into the well.\n\nTo begin with the topic of perforating a well, I have written about this earlier, but more from the point of the tools used to do the job. What I’d like to do here is to talk a little more about it from the rock point of view. As I mentioned last time the rock right around the well can be subject to a high enough pressure that it will partially fail, or crush, and this can lower the amount of fluid that can get through, or alternately it might have been damaged in some other way. By bringing in a tool with a set of shaped charges in it, and then firing these at the appropriate place this problem can be overcome.\n\nArrangement of shaped charges (the yellow cylinders) – when the explosive goes off the cones collapse and small liquid metal jets shoot out of the open end, through the casing, concrete and into the rock, creating a channel. (Core Labs)\n\nThe charges aren’t all necessarily fired at one time or place, even though, for the illustration below, they appear to be.\n\nRepresentation of shaped charges firing and penetrating the casing, cement and wall (OSHA)\n\nThe jet of metal that shoots out of the cone will travel into the rock roughly 10 cone diameters, as a rough rule of thumb, and this carries a channel, or tunnel, out through the damaged rock into the surrounding reservoir. The collapse and creation of the channel happens very fast:\n\nPenetration of a perforating charge into Plexiglas after 3, 12, 21 and 30 microseconds. Marks are in cone diameters. (after Konya*)\n\nThe channel is initially hollow, and drives a set of small and large cracks out into the rock around the line of the charge.\n\nJet penetration through Plexiglas (note the lateral cracks away from the line of penetration. The dark section is due to a change in background. (after Konya*)\n\nHowever, while it is easier to show the damage that the jet does by showing how it penetrates Plexiglas, this is not rock, but it does show some of the events that occur. When, for example, (vide the discussion on jointed shale last week) the jet shoots into rock where there are clear joint planes defined, then these act to stop the crack growth (perhaps in the way that those who used to remember stopping cracks growing in old cars by drilling a hole at the end of the crack. It distributes the stress that was causing the crack to grow when focused on the tip, over a larger area so that it drops below the critical level). Or the stress is high enough to cause cracks to form and be reflected back at the jet.\n\nJet damage confined between two adjacent planes when the charge is fired into plates that run parallel to the direction of the jet. (after Konya*)\n\nIf the charge is not carefully designed and used, therefore, it might not be as effective as initially hoped, and this becomes even more true if the pieces of metal that are formed when the cone collapses are carried into the channel and partially block it. There are different strategies, depending on the well and the surrounding rock and it is one of those things in life where, if you got it right the results are almost immediately obvious – as is the converse.\n\nCreating cracks that go out into the surrounding rock has become a vital part of the economic production of gas from the shales around the country, as we have discussed, and having a starting crack in the right direction, whether it is a natural joint in the rock, or a crack that has been deliberately created helps control where the crack starts and how it grows.\n\nCrack growing out from a drilled hole in Plexiglas, the small notch at the top of the hole controlled the direction of the growth of the crack (We put ink in the hole to show how the fluid goes into the crack).\n\nIn the above picture you can see that when the hole was pressurized, a crack grew, and ink flowed into the crack, as it formed, but, when the pressure came off, the crack closed and most of the ink was forced back out of the crack. (We created the pressure by firing an air rifle pellet into the hole).\n\nSo if we are going to have a useful crack we need to have it open after we take the pressure back off – after all we need to get the fluid back out of the well, so that the gas can pass up the well for collection.\n\nNow it is not quite as easy to grow the crack, or prop it open as I may have suggested earlier, and to explain some of the issues in a little more detail I am going to use an example", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

But the operation was suspended after an inquiry by MPs uncovered a litany of arbitrary murder, rape, torture and extortion of innocent people.\n\nMizengo Pinda, the prime minister, told Reuters: \"The anti-poaching operation had good intentions, but the reported murders, rapes and brutality are totally unacceptable.\"\n\nThe inquiry's findings – including the killing of 13 civilians and arrest of more than 1,000 people – led to the sacking of the tourism minister Khamis Kagasheki, who had called for perpetrators of the illicit ivory trade to be executed \"on the spot\",as well as the defence minister Shamsi Vuai Nahodha, the home affairs minister Emmanuel Nchimbi and the livestock development minister David Mathayo.\n\nNyalandu said that, with the operation on hold, the government would appeal to foreign donors to help Tanzania's wildlife department and ranger service. \"Those to be approached include the European Union and Asian countries,\" he was quoted as saying in media reports. \"Asian countries are reportedly the main consumers of elephant tusks and byproducts.\"\n\nThere is huge demand for elephant tusks in many Asian countries, where they are used to make ornaments. In August 2011, Tanzanian authorities seized more than 1,000 elephant tusks hidden in sacks of dried fish at Zanzibar port and destined for Malaysia.\n\nRecent research by the International Union for Conservation of Nature found that 22,000 elephants were killed in 2012 and Africa will lose one-fifth of its elephants in the next decade if the poaching crisis is not arrested. There were around 10m African elephants at the start of the 20th century, but that number has fallen to 500,000 owing to poaching and habitat loss.\n\nThe international trade in ivory was banned in 1989 but it has been dubbed the \"white gold of jihad\" by activists who say it is funding armed rebel groups including al-Shabaab, the militia behind the siege of the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, that left at least 67 people dead.\n\nWith 70,000-80,000 elephants in 2009, Tanzania is believed to be home to nearly a sixth of all African elephants. A recent census at one of the country's biggest wildlife parks, Selous Game Reserve, showed elephant populations had plummeted to just 13,000 from 55,000 previously.\n\nLast year a Tanzanian MP said poaching was out of control with an average of 30 elephants killed for their ivory every day. Media reports have alleged that some MPs and other officials are involved in and benefiting from the lucrative ivory trade.Sixty animals 'butchered' in two months since crackdown was suspended after inquiry uncovered murder, rape and extortion\n\nElephant deaths in Tanzania have risen dramatically since the government abandoned a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers, officials admit.\n\nLazaro Nyalandu, the deputy minister of natural resources and tourism, said 60 elephants were \"butchered\" in November and December, compared with two in October.\n\nSoldiers, police, game rangers and forestry officers had been involved in a month-long crackdown on poachers, codenamed Operation Terminate, in October.

{"id": "sample_6_31", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "ians and astronomers. The other men of learning were engaged in war work. Physicists were making better range-finders, chemists were making better poison gases, and theologians were proving that their gods were in the trenches qualifying for meritorious-conduct medals and kisses on both cheeks. But the astronomers and mathematicians were not doing their bits. While the war was in progress, Albert Einstein was completing his theory at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and British astronomers were working on plans to test it. It was fraternizing with the enemy. Scientists of this type have always been dangerous internationalists. They did incalculable harm to Church and State at an earlier time by casting suspicion on the Bible truth that the earth was flat and had four corners, and even today a man who meddles with the universe is regarded as unsafe. One of the organizers of the American Legion started an agitation to bar Einstein from the United States as a Red; the Woman Patriot Corporation lodged a complaint against him with the State Department; an American consular official nearly heckled the scientist into abandoning an American trip; Cardinal O’Connell denounced the Einstein theory as false, atheistic, and immoral; a religious writer charged that Einstein had cribbed the theory from the writings of a thirteenth-century saint. Nevertheless, Einstein slipped past the immigration authorities in 1930, and he did it again last October. Today, he is openly carrying on mathematical work at Princeton. The anti-nationalistic taint in astronomy manifested itself when British astronomers, even before the Treaty of Versailles had been signed, confirmed the new theory that had been made in Germany. On May 29, 1919, two expeditions under the Union Jack—one at Sobral in Brazil, and the other at Principe off the coast of West Africa—photographed an eclipse in order to discover whether starlight, as Einstein’s calculations had indicated, was twisted when it passed a massive body like the sun. They reported that Einstein was right. Since then, his theory has been retouched in detail, but its essentials have been repeatedly verified. No important scientist is to be found among the skeptics, although there is every incentive to debunk Einstein, if it can be done. Immortality awaits the man who can overthrow Einstein. The popular uproar over the theory surprised no one more than the author of the theory. He had been almost a recluse. His contacts had been with quiet, scholarly men of his own type, and his sudden glory appalled him. Interviewers, photographers, lion-hunters, cause-promoters, testimonial-seekers, and reflected-glory chasers of every kind came swarming into his life. A man of soft, plastic nature, Einstein was helpless in their hands. He was forced into the rôle of publicist, propagandist, and oracle. After fourteen years of experience with international nuisances and go-getters, Einstein has developed some resistance, but he has not yet learned how to say “No” successfully, and he is still the prey of determined busybodies. The Einstein of 1933 has become fairly reconciled to the occupation of popular idol. He has developed into a mixer, a wit, an authority on things in general, and the probable successor of George Bernard Shaw as the world’s miscellaneous consulting expert, but his countenance still reflects the bewilderment of his early years as a demigod in spite of himself. Permanent astonishment shines from his great eyes under their apprehensive brows.\n\nWhen he first became famous, Einstein was a strange compound of cosmic wisdom and worldly inexperience. Presented by Lord Haldane to the Royal Society in England as a man of unparalleled intellectual boldness, Einstein found himself intimidated by the livery of the Haldane retainers. “He is too formidable,” said the Professor later at the Haldane place, when Mrs. Einstein wanted to summon the butler to fix a window. When he visited the Queen of the Belgians, Einstein failed to notice the welcoming party at the railway station and surprised the royal household by arriving on foot, baggage in hand. The Professor and his wife were both bewildered by the barbaric hospitality which overwhelmed them on their earlier visits to this country. They agreed that they must blindly accept whatever occurred to them in this bizarre republic; at a dinner in Cleveland, Mrs. Einstein, shrugging her shoulders at what appeared to be an elegant American eccentricity, ate a bouquet of orchids which she found on what seemed to be a salad plate. Einstein knew things that everybody else was ignorant of, and was ignorant of things that everybody else knew. The name of the richest man in the world meant nothing to him. He used a $1,500 check from the Rockefeller Foundation as a bookmark, lost the book, and could not remember who had sent the check. It took Mrs. Einstein some weeks to clear up the affair and to obtain a duplicate check, which was", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

The citizens filed the petition under this committee’s banner, they did not sign it individually. So I think the rejection was rightly done,” Reza said after the court gave its ruling.\n\nIn 2011, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina brought back secularism as a pillar of the Constitution, but retained Islam as the state religion, understandably because of its popular support in a country where more than 90% of the population is Muslim.\n\nSubrata Chowdhury, the lead lawyer for the petitioners, said he had no clear idea why his petition was rejected.\n\n“We will be able to talk about this in detail after seeing the full observation of the court,” Chowdhury said. “We have to wait for that.”\n\nHefajat-e-Islam, a major Islamist group, welcomed the court’s decision. “This is the victory of the Muslim ummah,” said Mujibur Rahman Hamidi, a leader of the group.\n\nFazlul Karim Kashemy, another leader of the group, said non-Muslims’ rights will not be affected by the decision.\n\n“We have been living together for long, we will stay like this. Our co-existence will not be affected,” he said as his supporters surrounded him outside the court.\n\nFirst Published: Mar 28, 2016 16:47 ISTBangladesh’s High Court on Monday summarily rejected a 28-year-old writ petition seeking the removal of Islam as the state religion of the Muslim-majority country.\n\nFormer military dictator HM Ershad declared Islam the state religion through a constitutional amendment in 1988 to win popular support in the face of a campaign by major political parties to oust him from power.\n\nOn Monday, a bench of three judges made the decision on the ground that the committee under which the petition was filed in 1988 had no legitimacy as it was not a registered body, said Murad Reza, an additional attorney general who opposed the petition on behalf of the government.\n\nAlso, almost half of the group of 15 eminent citizens who filed the petition have died, and Islamist groups have at various times described the petitioners as “atheists”.\n\nThe decision means Islam will stay as the state religion in the nation’s charter, which also speaks of equal rights for other religious minorities, Reza said.\n\n“The writ petition was filed by the Autocracy and Communalism Resistance Committee but this committee was never registered with the government.

{"id": "sample_6_43", "config_id": 6, "prompt": ", the beach is lovely, and there is lots of space for recreation. We saw many large groups who had come prepared for the day with coolers and barbecues.\n\nI spoke to people who live in the neighbourhood, who enthused about how lucky they are to have such a beautiful spot just down the road. They go down to the water all the time. They live less than a kilometre away. They drive.\n\nWhen I mentioned we had walked, they exclaimed at how dangerous that was. The lack of sidewalks is not unique to Brimley Road in this area. Bluffer’s Park Road, which runs along the waterfront, doesn’t have any sidewalks either, although at least there is the option of taking the path through the park (which runs beside the road in places).\n\nChine Drive, the next street west from Brimley off Kingston Road, was the site of a small skirmish over sidewalks a few years ago that went all the way to the Ministry of the Environment. A petition to “Save Chine Drive Forest” argued that the area was basically rural and that sidewalks would displace trees and wildlife.\n\nA girl was killed on one of those sidewalk-less roads in 2013, in a neighbourhood just west of Midland, between Kingston Road and Scarborough Heights Park.\n\nIn response, several residents in the area petitioned for sidewalks. On Chine Drive, there had been a plan for a sidewalk since at least 2004, because Chine Drive has a local elementary school, and parents wanted a safe path for kids to walk. Dylan Reid wrote a good summary of that debate.\n\nThey compromised on a sidewalk on just one side, using the existing roadway space to minimize tree removal. It was built the following year. (I’m in favour of sidewalks on both sides, but it’s a start.)\n\nThe next year saw the same skirmish flare up on Midland Avenue.\n\nJust in case you think this only happens in Scarborough, the same debate took place in Lawrence Park last summer.\n\nSuch sidewalk disputes are usually framed as local, neighbourhood issues.\n\nBut our little trip to Bluffer’s Park demonstrates that the lack of sidewalks is not just a local issue, it’s a “last mile” problem for using transit in and out of the area.\n\nThe “last mile” problem refers to the gap between transit riders’ residences and their transit stations. The GO Train system is a perfect example. Train stations are surrounded by vast moats of parking because riders commonly have few (or no) good options for getting to the station except to drive.\n\nMore people will take transit if they have better access to it. It’s not merely a question of distance. Studies have shown commuters will walk as much as a mile, but what that route looks like can make all the difference.\n\nPeople don’t enjoy circuitous routes that make them feel like the journey is longer than it needs to be. And they don’t like walking alongside fast-moving traffic, or having to cross multi-lane boulevards, or any other conditions that make them feel vulnerable.\n\nA complete transit system would enable riders to go door to door without needing to get in their cars to access the system in the first place. That means solving the last mile problem with modes of public transit that connect efficiently, comfortably and reliably to bigger systems like the GO Train.\n\nReducing the need to drive to train stations will also free up lots of valuable land around stations for a more useful purpose, and make the stations more accessible.\n\nWhile solutions such as shuttle buses and cycling get a lot of attention, experts say that plain old walking is “among the most useful and cost-effective first and last mile strategies.” Walking and sidewalks are part of the public transit system.\n\nSean Marshall noted last year that up to a quarter of local Toronto roads do not have sidewalks. Marshall’s piece includes a great map that he produced, which shows that there are no sidewalks on either side of almost all of the roads between Warden Avenue and Scarborough Village, between Kingston Road and the water—despite the fact that there are lakeside parks running almost the full length of that stretch.\n\nLast year, city planners recommended a new protocol to curtail the ability to protest sidewalks, so that the City could install them in the interest of safety and accessibility where it saw fit, despite any objections.\n\nBluffer’s Park and other lakeside greenery should be open and accessible to everyone. We want the whole city to enjoy them, but we don’t want the whole city to drive there. Certainly the locals wouldn’t welcome more traffic and parking problems.\n\nJust as important, the people who live in the area ought to have better access to the transit that runs along Kingston Road.

{"id": "sample_6_46", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " professional associations and chambers of commerce and some sports leagues, is a category that… carries with it exemption from paying federal and state corporate income tax on your net income.”\n\nAnd, the NFL isn’t alone. The National Hockey League, the Professional Golfers’ Association, the U.S. Tennis Association and numerous other sporting leagues also enjoy similar statuses. So, how did such a situation come about?\n\nSince the 1940’s, the NFL has received some tax breaks from federal and state governments. However, it wasn’t until 1966 that language was formally added to the national tax code which officially protected professional football. At the time, there were not one but two professional football leagues: the NFL and the American Football League or the AFL. On June 8, 1966, the two leagues formally announced plans to merge. The first ever Super Bowl was also held that very season. In order to merge, the leagues had to approach Congress to ask for an exemption to antitrust laws, which prohibit monopolies that limit competition.\n\nNitty Gritty Tax Law\n\nAfter a lobbying blitz by both the NFL and the AFL, Congress eventually agreed to allow the two leagues to merge. During that same time, football lobbyists also pushed for the NFL to be explicitly added to federal tax code as a trade association. As a result, Section 6 of Unites States Code 26 regarding 501 exemptions was modified to read as such:\n\n(6)Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\n\nAccording to the IRS, in order to be considered a trade association and, therefore, tax exempt, the league’s activities must:\n\n“Be devoted to the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business as distinguished from the performance of particular services for individual persons. It must be shown that the conditions of a particular trade or the interests of the community will be advanced. Merely indicating the name of the organization or the object of the local statute under which it is created is not enough to demonstrate the required general purpose.”\n\nIn its 2010 990 tax return form, the NFL described itself as a “trade association promoting interests of its 32 member clubs.” Whether or not promoting the interests of 32 member clubs equates to improving business condition is up to the IRS to decide.\n\nBecause the phrase ‘professional football leagues’ was added to the text, the NFL is protected, but the Internal Revenue Service takes that to mean other sporting leagues are as well. This is a notion Tenenbaum himself sees as suspect.\n\n“I think the legitimate question is, ‘does the fact that they were written in so specifically, with some very particular, specific language, does that mean that Congress actually meant to exempt the NFL from taxes under section 501c6 or was Congress simply saying a professional sports league that broadly promotes a particular sport, that’s another category of what we mean by 501c6, the NFL may or may not be one of those. We really don’t know the answer to that.”\n\nA Look at the NFL’s Playbook\n\nTo truly understand whether or not the NFL meets those criteria, a basic understanding of the organization’s structure is required.\n\nThe league’s origin goes all the way back to September 17, 1920, when team owners and football enthusiasts came together in Canton, Ohio to organize a central group that makes and enforces rules. Today, the NFL represents 32 teams in two conferences: the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).\n\nThe organization's main duties include hiring league employees, disciplining people who break the rules, negotiating television deals, distributing money from those television profits to teams, suspending players and coaches, handing down fines and, in serious cases, canceling contracts or striping teams of draft picks.\n\nIn order to be able to conduct its business, each team pays annual dues. According to Forbes, only about $500,000 of the league's money comes in annually from fines and penalties and less than $200,000 comes from investment income. Teams pay the organization about $6 million in dues annually. However, as SportsFans.org reports, team owners are not taxed on that money since it is considered a donation to a nonprofit organization.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the NFL in its entirety is the most profitable sport in the US, the league itself is actually operating in the red. In 2011 alone, the NFL reported $77 million in losses.\n\n“The expenses outweigh the revenues so it is actually losing money. So the irony is if it were a taxable entity it wouldn’t be paying any", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_53", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "U.S. needs 'to do right' for immigrant children: official\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. official said on Sunday the U.S. border is not open to illegal entry into the country, but acknowledged the government does need to be sensitive to the tens of thousands of migrant children flowing into detention centers.\n\nMore than 52,000 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have been caught trying to sneak over the U.S.-Mexico border since October, double the number from the same period the year before. Thousands more have been apprehended with parents or other adults.\n\n\"We have to do right by the children, but at the end of the day, our border is not open to illegal migration and we will stem the tide,\" Jeh Johnson, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\n\nJohnson said that the government administers deportation proceedings to illegal migrants seized at the border, including children. But he added that the government is looking at being more flexible toward the children seized at the border.\n\n\"We are looking at ways to create additional options for dealing with the children, in particular, consistent with our laws and our values,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson repeated the stance, taken by President Barack Obama last week, that the president would take executive action to revamp the U.S. immigration system.\n\n\"There are a number of things the president and I, within the confines of existing law, can do to fix the broken immigration system. If Congress doesn't act, we will,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson would not answer a question on the Sunday show pertaining to whether the U.S. government would deport the current wave of Central American children, saying only that U.S. authorities would stem the tide, and that deportation processes are commenced against illegal immigrants.\n\nU.S. immigration officials say the crisis is being driven by a mix of extreme poverty, gangs and drug violence in Central America, as well as rumors perpetuated by human smugglers that children who reach the U.S. border will be allowed to stay.\n\nCritics say that the Obama administration has not moved quickly enough to address the problem.\n\nRepresentative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose congressional district includes a stretch of the Texas-Mexico border, said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" program that 48,000 people, including 9,700 children traveling without parents, were detained on the Texas border in May. \"We should have been ready for this surge,\" he said. \"The administration should have been ready ... They should have seen this coming a long time ago.\"\n\nIdaho Representative Raul Labrador, a Republican, said the U.S. needs to take a strong stance against what is happening at border facilities.\n\n\"The thing that the administration needs to do is immediately deport these families, these children. I know it sounds harsh, I know it sounds difficult, but they're creating a crisis that's going to harm these children,\" he said on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nLabrador added that the frustration building up is because the administration is doing nothing about border security.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Jim Loney and Frances Kerry)U.S. needs 'to do right' for immigrant children: official\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. official said on Sunday the U.S. border is not open to illegal entry into the country, but acknowledged the government does need to be sensitive to the tens of thousands of migrant children flowing into detention centers.\n\nMore than 52,000 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have been caught trying to sneak over the U.S.-Mexico border since October, double the number from the same period the year before.

{"id": "sample_6_59", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " Industry figures like Nick Wooster, a retail veteran with stints at Neiman Marcus, JC Penney and GILT; Eugene Tong, stylist and former style director at Details; and Josh Peskowitz, former fashion director at Bloomingdale’s, became street style celebrities to a very specific set of dudes who couldn’t stop aggregating their photos — partly from outfit-envy, and partly because they just looked damn cool.\n\nJosh Peskowitz, former fashion director at Bloomingdale's, attends New York Fashion Week: Men's. Image: Miles Goscha/Mashable\n\nBut beyond the social platform, its roots began in forum culture. Communities like StyleForum, SuperFuture and Ask Andy About Clothes predated Reddit’s popular Male Fashion Advice subreddit, and provided safe, anonymous spaces for guys to nerd out about pick stitches, fully canvassed suits, Filson bags and Alden Indy Boots alike. Guys were learning how to define themselves with clothes without fear of being judged.\n\nBut the insider nature of forums made it hard for neophytes to fully dive in.\n\nEnter the menswear site circa 2008, a specialized vertical in which the basic tenets of how dudes dress — filtered through forum culture in an online version of \"Telephone\" — were made all the more digestible.\n\n“Sites like Valet, Selectism and Uncrate that were looking to contribute to a conversation about men improving their life and style,” says Cory Ohlendorf, who founded Valet in 2008. “And you had regular guys like Lawrence Schlossman looking to be part of that conversation.”\n\n11/13/15 - Last day A photo posted by Legend (@sartoriallyinc) on Nov 13, 2015 at 2:00pm PST\n\n#Menswear’s Judgement Day, the moment a dandified Skynet achieved self-awareness, occurred when Schlossman and Kevin Burrows launched their parody site Fuck Yeah Menswear, a Tumblr that became a book in 2012. Later that year, Schlossman was appointed as the editor-in-chief of Four Pins, which carried the same spirit of the well-dressed snake eating itself.\n\nImage: Daniel Zuchnik/Getty\n\n“The aim was just to be completely honest that there are no real justifications for buying expensive clothes other than you wanting them,” says Jon Moy, one of Four Pins’ most prolific writers, on the site’s tone.\n\nMore traditional menswear nerd culture began to converge with hype culture, a digital consumer market obsessed with the latest and greatest obscure Japanese brands and anything emblazoned with labels from cult brands like A Bathing Ape, Supreme or Stüssy. And sneakers, always sneakers.\n\nSupreme/The North Face® A photo posted by Supreme (@supremenewyork) on Nov 16, 2015 at 8:09am PST\n\nFor men, timelessness gave way to trendiness, and style wasn’t just about making yourself look good — it became about looking better than everyone else and being first at it.\n\n“By the time a blogger maybe does some research, buys some pieces for himself, tests the look out, and wants to talk to about it, the trend has potentially eclipsed,” says Lawrence Schlossman. “The service angle of the blog — what is that anymore?”\n\nIndeed, more and more men are discovering new brands, designers and even ways to wear certain items via Instagram, rather than men’s sites. As a result, context and storytelling are secondary to visual presentation. Learning about a label’s provenance or educating consumers about things like pedigree and history aren’t as important to the modern menswear guy.\n\n“The media landscape has shifted so much towards Instagram that you don’t necessary need words,” adds Schlossman. “No one wants to consume directly from a website anymore, which is a bummer.”\n\nNick Wooster, arguably one of #menswear’s most prominent personalities, doesn’t see it as a zero-sum game. While he sees the current state of media as “in flux,” he thinks media companies and retailers just need to add yet another avenue to build brand awareness.\n\n“You might learn about something on Instagram the way you learned about it from a magazine 20 years ago, but the way you still consume it or get further information is a traditional channel,” he says.\n\nNick Wooster models for Public School's men's fashion week showing in New York City.

In the fact sections of the complaint, plaintiff carefully refrains from alleging that the owners of the IP address – i.e., the named defendants – are the ones who utilized the internet access to download the copyrighted material. Rather, plaintiff alleges that the IP address assigned to each defendant “was observed infringing Plaintiff’s motion picture” ... and that each named defendant either (a) downloaded the BitTorrent “client” application and used it to download and share the copyrighted material or (b) permitted, facilitated, or promoted the use of their internet connections by others to download and share the copyrighted material .... Pursuant to plaintiff’s allegations, a particular defendant may have directly and intentionally stolen plaintiff’s copyrighted material, or she may simply have “facilitated” unauthorized copying by purchasing an internet connection which an unidentified third party utilized to download “Elf-Man.” Plaintiff provides no factual allegations that make one scenario more likely than the other: both are merely possible given the alternative allegations of the complaint.\n\n[....] The critical defect in this case is not the alternative pleading of claims of direct, contributory, and indirect infringement. Rather, the problem arises from the alternative pleading of the facts that are supposed to support those claims. The effect of the two “or” conjunctions means that plaintiff has actually alleged no more than that the named defendants purchased internet access and failed to ensure that others did not use that access to download copyrighted material.\n\nA few courts have noted similar things, but Fight Copyright Trolls and TorrentFreak both recently covered an interesting district court ruling out of Seattle, where Judge Robert Lansik noted that the producers of the movie Elf Man failed to state a claim for relief, since the only evidence they had was an IP address -- which wasn't enough to actually implicate any particular person in copyright infringement.Of course, we've seen plenty of copyright holders directly allege that failure of a internet account holder to stop infringement is somehow a violation of the law itself, but that's not what the law says at all. Here, the judge is correctly noting that make a huge inference from just the IP address to having enough for a lawsuit makes the plaintiff's claim not enough to move forward. This is only a district court ruling, but as a few other courts have made some similar claims, perhaps it can be useful in pushing back on standard copyright trolling, as courts become less willing to entertain fishing expeditions by trolls.\n\nFiled Under: copyright, infringement, ip addressCourt Dismisses Copyright Lawsuit, Noting IP Address Is Not Enough Evidence For Infringement\n\nfrom the nice-to-see dept\n\nPlaintiff’s complaint does not raise a plausible inference that any of the named defendants are liable for direct, contributory, or indirect copyright infringement.

Scientists have announced that the volcanic activity beneath the National Park's surface may be far bigger and better connected than once thought.\n\nThe National Park is home to hot springs, mudpots, fumaroles and geysers, so it's not surprising that it has quite a bit of volcanic activity under the ground. Known as a hotspot, a massive volume of molten magma is located beneath Yellowstone. This plume of superheated rock rises from Earth's mantle, punching through the continent's crust as North America has slowly drifted over it. The phenomenon has left a trail of calderas created by massive volcanic eruptions in its wake; the most recent occurred about 640,000 years ago.\n\nYellowstone is infamous for its potential for a \"super eruption.\" When the Huckleberry Ridge eruption in Yellowstone occurred about 2 million years ago, it darkened the skies with ash from southern California to the Mississippi River. It was one of the largest eruptions to have occurred on our planet. Understanding the volcanic activity of this location is therefore crucial for predicting future eruptions.\n\nSo how did researchers find out about the new size of this hotspot? They analyzed earthquakes, examining the seismic waves as they travelled through the earth. Since these waves change speed depending on whether they travel through molten or solid rock, the scientists were able to determine exactly how big the mass of molten material beneath the surface is.\n\n\"We are getting a much better understand of the volcanic system of Yellowstone,\" said Jamie Farrell, a seismology graduate student at the University of Utah, in an interview with LiveScience.com. \"The magma reservoir is at least 50 percent larger than previously imagined.\"\n\nThe reservoir isn't just bigger; it's also more connected. The researchers discovered that instead of individual pockets, the underground magma is centered in one giant mass. About 37 miles long and 18 miles wide, the magma helps power the volcanic activity seen at the park.\n\nThe new findings could allow scientists to better predict future eruptions in the area. In addition, it has given them some more insight into what makes Yellowstone and its geysers tick.\n\nThe findings were reported at the Seismological Society of America's annual meeting.Yellowstone has the world's largest collection of geysers, and it has the underground plumbing to prove it.

{"id": "sample_6_81", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " – the fourth best team in 2013 and one that was within touching distance of beating Mercedes and Ferrari – has had to employ a driver who scored a single championship point this year does not reflect well on the sport. The typically quirky Lotus social media team decided to announce the deal with a picture of Grosjean and Maldonado colliding in GP2 three years ago…\n\nMaldonado has raw speed – albeit he was trumped by rookie Valtteri Bottas this season – and at times he has aptly demonstrated his ability in the sport. Having stormed to the GP2 title in 2010, he joined Williams when the team produced a mediocre car. But his drive in Monaco in 2011 was sublime, while his weekend in Spain in 2012 was sensational, even if he was aided by the penalty to Lewis Hamilton. On that day in May 2012, he held Fernando Alonso at bay for 66 laps and delivered Williams their first win in eight years. There were also other good races – his performances in Spain and Abu Dhabi were mature, as he dealt with the adversity that was thrown his way. At those moments, he delivered when it mattered. Lesser drivers would not have done so.\n\nBut for all of his high points, they are indeed contrasted with a tendency to get involved in trouble. He threw away a bagful of points through silly contact in 2012 – the prime example being his impatience in Valencia - while at times his approach to racing means he causes unnecessary problems for himself. It’s highly unlikely that Lotus will be able to change his attitude, for while he is a pleasant person outside of the car, his personality appears to alter inside the cockpit. When Grosjean made errors, he was a broken man and vowed to improve himself. He did. When Maldonado makes mistakes, he never accepts the blame and therefore does not see that a different approach would assist his cause. Perhaps Monaco is the best place to analyse Maldonado’s Jekyll and Hyde racing personality: in 2005, he seriously injured a marshal during an FR3.5 race, in GP2 he was phenomenal around the principality, winning twice, while in 2011 he put in his best drive of his rookie season. Then in 2012 he made a dubious move on Sergio Pérez in practice, crashed out of the session and then blundered into an accident at the start. Nevertheless, while trading Kimi Räikkönen for Maldonado is far from the deal of the century, occasionally in 2014 – given the right equipment – the Venezuelan will pleasantly surprise his detractors. He is not a world champion in waiting, but he is a race winner and an infinitely better driver than some that have participated in the sport.\n\nThe bigger issue in hand is the money. There have been doubts about Lotus’s financial state for a few years but the signing of Maldonado is proof that not only was there not enough money to retain Räikkönen, but there was not enough to sign Nico Hülkenberg, arguably the driver that Lotus would have wanted. Effectively, Maldonado is therefore an enforced third choice. Some blame has to lie with Lotus’s marketing department, who have evidently not been as successful as hoped, despite having employed a popular world champion for the past two years. The Quantum deal is still being negotiated, so for Lotus’s sake one can only hope that there is a positive outcome for all involved. But Maldonado’s move to Lotus highlights the perilous financial state of several teams on the grid. Costs are rising unsustainably but the sport cannot get together as a unit and begin to address the issues at hand due to conflicting motives. Rumours persist that a few teams are considering mergers – Caterham and Marussia held discussions about doing so last winter – while midfield outfits such as Sauber and Force India are waiting for whichever two drivers can stump up the most cash. It’s frustrating for fans to see talented drivers miss out on top seats, but survival of the teams is the priority – hundreds of people and their families are reliant on salaries that need paying. Painting Lotus team principal Eric Boullier as the antichrist is misguided. But what this should be is another wake-up call to the sport that the current financial model as a whole is unsustainable. Formula 1 is dreaming up mandatory stops and fixed car numbers for drivers during a period of ongoing global financial problems, while the suits continue to exploit a sport that they do not understand. It is naturally a money-driven business, but until the method of short-term profit is abandoned, then the current situation will only be exacerbated.\n\nFinancial difficulties in motorsport are not a new phenomenon but the development of the sport is such that the spending has rocketed uncontrollably. The major impact for the fans is that the likes of Hülkenberg miss out on a competitive seat, while others such as Robin Frijns can’t even get a shot in", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

But the city manager says that the effort would likely be rebuffed, since the council has already deemed the position to be unnecessary.\n\nPeaks Island resident Timmi Sellers asked the city in a May 18 email how residents could earmark a donation to pay for Jason Shedlock’s salary, which would have been roughly $69,000 next year.\n\nJason Shedlock, assistant to the mayor, speaks to the council before its vote terminating his position this month. He said that listening to people talk about him was like \"watching your own funeral.\" Staff photo by Derek Davis Related Headlines Portland Mayor Strimling says he may veto budget over council’s vote to cut his assistant\n\nSellers, who was impressed that Mayor Ethan Strimling and Shedlock recently attended a meeting on Peaks Island to hear concerns about the loss of mainland parking, said in an interview that she was moved to act after watching the emotional debate leading up to the City Council’s May 15 vote.\n\n“I was pretty shocked at the viciousness of the personal attacks on the mayor after he explained very carefully why the position was so important to him,” she said. “I had voted for the mayor’s position and I want it to be successful. I consider one year a short time for this to be evaluated.”\n\nSellers said she and a few other neighborhood leaders, who she declined to identify, were interested in raising money, but wanted to first check with the city about the legality before launching the effort.\n\nResidents are allowed make donations to the city. According to the City Council’s rules, donations in excess of $5,000 must be accepted and appropriated by the council, which voted 6-3 to eliminate the position, partly because it was unpopular with their constituents.\n\n“The Council’s decision to eliminate the funding for the position was not because the City could not afford it, but because they felt that the position was redundant and no longer necessary in its current capacity,” City Manager Jon Jennings said in an email to Sellers. “Given their decision above, it does not seem likely to me that they would accept a donation for this purpose, and I take my direction from them.”\n\nAfter receiving the city’s response, Sellers said Wednesday she would be meeting with family, friends and some neighborhood organizations next week to figure out their next steps.\n\n“I think in some format we will be moving forward. In some way we will be trying to assist in the healing of our dysfunctional government,” Sellers said. “I don’t know if raising money and forcing the City Council to look at this again will be helpful and I want to be helpful.”\n\nThe elimination of the mayor’s assistant marked what may be a new low in the relationship between the council and Strimling, who said the cut “undermines democracy” by hindering his ability to respond to constituents and draft new city policies, among other tasks.\n\nCity Councilor Spencer Thibodeau said the position had prevented Strimling from collaborating with councilors, whose support is needed to enact his initiatives. But Strimling said eliminating the position would only “make it worse.”\n\nThe idea of eliminating the position emerged late in the budget process. Strimling considered vetoing the entire $240 million city budget over the position but announced Monday that he would not do so, because it would foster “political maneuvering, grandstanding and infighting and will only serve to further divide our city.”\n\nInstead, Strimling called on the council to form a task force to review the City Charter and offer recommendations about ways to make the mayor’s office more effective. That idea was immediately shot down by some councilors, who noted that the city has had two legal reviews of the charter, including one that cost nearly $22,000, explaining the mayor’s role.\n\nRandy Billings can be reached at 791-6346 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @randybillings\n\nShareA small group of Portland residents is offering to raise money to fund the special assistant to the mayor after it was eliminated from the budget by the City Council.

{"id": "sample_6_103", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " a rumored project simply known as Google Me. It all started with a Twitter update from Digg founder Kevin Rose saying that he’d heard a rumor from a “very credible source” that Google would be launching a “Facebook competitor very soon” called Google Me. That tweet has since been removed, which may or may not indicate that Google asked him to do so.\n\nThen a former Facebook higher-up named Adam D’Angelo chimed in, saying the following:\n\n“Here is what I’ve pieced together from some reliable sources:\n\n– This is not a rumor. This is a real project. There are a large number of people working on it. I am completely confident about this.\n\n– They realized that Buzz wasn’t enough and that they need to build out a full, first-class social network. They are modeling it off of Facebook.\n\n– Unlike previous attempts (before Buzz at least), this is a high-priority project within Google.\n\n– They had assumed that Facebook’s growth would slow as it grew, and that Facebook wouldn’t be able to have too much leverage over them, but then it just didn’t stop, and now they are really scared.”\n\nFacebook has made no qualms about going after Google, hiring away Google’s VP of Global Online Sales and Operations, Sheryl Sandberg, to become Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer. And the recent introduction of Facebook’s Open Graph protocol is seen by many as a direct attempt to entice members to conduct their web searches from within Facebook itself—no need to hop over to Google to look something up.\n\nYou may recall that Google’s tried its hand at the whole social networking thing already. There’s Orkut, an actual social network that never really caught on in the US, though it’s apparently huge in Brazil and India. And then there’s Buzz, a Twitter-like something or other that’s been buried in most people’s inboxes in favor of, well, Twitter.\n\nAnd therein lies Google’s main challenge. How do you lure people away from a service they already use?\n\nIs Buzz vastly superior to Twitter? You can embed photos and full blog posts into Buzz and you can see people’s comments on your updates. Cool, sure, but Twitter is still the go-to standard for simple, short, ADD-friendly updates. Google’s made it clear that its strategy is “mobile first” and, wouldn’t you know it, the mobile version of Google Buzz is actually pretty awesome if you’ve bothered to use it. The desktop version, however, isn’t providing a good reason to dump Twitter.\n\nIf the rumors are to be believed, it’d stand to reason that Google would leverage Buzz as the newsfeed-type feature of Google Me. And Google has millions of users already, which would make signing up for Google Me a snap. But like it learned with Buzz, just having a lot of users doesn’t mean much without giving them a good reason to switch.\n\nIt can easily replicate most or all of Facebook’s features—friending, photos, apps, videos, etc.—but it’s going to need to give people features they won’t find elsewhere. Otherwise, nobody needs yet another social network to join.\n\nSo what would it take for you to leave Facebook for Google Me? I got dragged into Facebook kicking and screaming because I don’t care all that much to connect with people I haven’t seen in 15 years (I use Facebook only for personal friends I know in real life and Twitter for work-related connections) but it’s mildly amusing to see who’s doing what every once in awhile. For me, Google would first and foremost need to provide a way for users to import their Facebook profile information and, next, most of everyone I’m friends with on Facebook would have to switch to Google Me.\n\nA simplified interface would be nice, too. I don’t spend enough time inside Facebook to know where everything is located and the rare instances when I want to tweak something, it seems like all the options are multiple menus deep. There’s also a certain allure to having all your Google-related stuff in one place: Cram Gmail, search, Google Voice, Google Wave, the rumored Google Music service, Google Docs, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Reader, and whatever else all under one roof and I’d be inclined to switch.\n\nAnd then there’s the privacy issues. You don’t hear much from regular Facebook users about privacy but you hear plenty from tech bloggers and pundits about the company’s mismanagement of users’ data", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_6_104", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " its Democratic party has changed dramatically since Koch endorsed Al Gore, who, stuck in third place in a three-way race, opened New York’s contest by accusing Michael Dukakis of putting “public pressure on Israel” due to his a “naive legalism, an exaggerated faith in the United Nations, and a seeming reluctance to ever have the United States act on its own when necessary.”\n\nFrom there, it was off to the races as Koch endorsing Gore and firing some wild shots at Dukakis and especially Jackson.\n\nThat 1988 primary was the worst, but in just about every New York primary since, candidates in both parties have competed to out-Israel each other, which has usually meant adopting not merely pro-Israel talking points but pro-Likud ones.\n\nI expressed the fear after Sanders won Wisconsin that Clinton might try to turn New York into an Israel referendum. She could have. And maybe she would have if the polls were closer. But she has not.\n\nNot only that. The needle moved significantly, and astoundingly, in the other direction. Here, Sanders deserves tremendous credit.\n\nHe said at last Thursday’s debate: “As somebody who is 100 percent pro-Israel, in the long run—and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.”\n\nAn acknowledgement that Palestinians are human beings—during a New York primary, no less!\n\nClinton could have—and 12 or so years ago, undoubtedly would have—responded by saying something like until the Palestinians get better leaders and stop teaching hatred to their children, my posture won’t change. Not only did she not do that, but Sanders forced her to acknowledge the point.\n\nShe said: “As Secretary of State for President Obama, I’m the person who held the last three meetings between the President of the Palestinian Authority and the Prime Minister of Israel. … Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians. I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.”\n\nSanders is to be commended for this anti-pandering—it could herald the start of a positive change in the way Democrats at least talk about the Middle East. But he was also able to get away with it because New York has changed so much. In 2011, Ed Koch came from seemingly nowhere to hijack the special election to replace Anthony Weiner in the House, turning it into a nationally viewed referendum on Obama’s Israel policies and costing Democrats what had seemed like a safe seat in the process. That was his last hurrah, and may have also been the last one for the staunchly pro-Israel Jewish Democrats who were once a dominant force in the party’s politics.\n\nThe Jews who remain in the party, especially those younger than 40 or so, are much more anti-Likud than the generation that’s been dying off (if Koch were still alive, he’d probably have popped off about Sanders’s comment, and we’d have stormed our way back to 1988 again).\n\nOn that one, Sanders showed that he’s more in touch with the current mindset of a crucial New York constituency than Clinton is. But with regard to African-American and Latino voters, especially those older than 40 (which is to say most of them), he still displays no feel at all for them, and no intrinsic empathy. Carrying on as he has about the South being “conservative” is, as I wrote last week, insulting to black voters everywhere. I’d have to bet this is a big topic of discussion on New York black radio, and was Sunday in the social halls of AME churches from Brooklyn to Buffalo.\n\nIf Clinton wins, the margin will again be provided by these voters. I’ll be very interested to see what the tallies are in state’s three political regions: the city, the suburbs (Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam), and upstate. If the polls are right and Clinton wins by double digits, she should carry them all; and with 247 total delegates at stake (not including the supers), the difference between a 12-point win and a three-point win could amount to 12 or 13 delegates—a huge difference at this point in the campaign.\n\nI was standing in that field on Pat Moynihan’s farm that day in July 1999 when Clinton first put herself out there as New York’s future senator.

Allí, en los dos viajes por el sótano, al entrar y al salir de la torre, aquellos peligrosos personajes de la violencia criminal de Guatemala le catalogaron como “basura”.\n\nDuarte cumplió una primera semana de haber finalizado una fuga que inició el 14 de octubre de 2016 y, según su relato ante el trío de jueces, con seis meses escondido en Guatemala. Pero el 19 de abril de 2017, al cumplir exactamente 43 años y siete meses de edad, el “doctor en Economía y ex funcionario” vivió una tarde para el olvido.\n\nTras su arresto el sábado 15 de abril, solamente hubo una aparición pública del ex gobernador de Veracruz y ocurrió el miércoles 19.\n\nCaída. La secuencia cúspide de lo que hasta ahora ha sido la estadía de Duarte en Guatemala se registro desde que, a las 12:20, descendió de una patrulla con celda en una calle de acceso a la torre, hasta casi las 16:00, cuando cayó de espaldas—engrilletado de pies y manos a la espalda— en una lámina del piso de esa jaula móvil, al retornar al vehículo policial para regresar a Matamoros.\n\nAntes y después de la audiencia, siempre guardó silencio. En público únicamente habló en el interrogatorio del juez César García, presidente del Tribunal Quinto de Sentencia Penal, Narcoactividad y Delitos contra el Ambiente, a cargo del caso, como cuando respondió primero sobre su identificación, las de sus parientes, domicilio y acerca de sus cargos y estudios.\n\nFue cuando el ex gobernador de Veracruz, de pie por orden de García, esposado y desatado momentáneamente de los pies por disposición del juez, con un chaleco antibalas, se mostró seguro y sereno tras un atribulado recorrido —rostro serio, molesto— de la calle de acceso al piso 11, con escala en el sótano y en un elevador saturado, y dijo: “Doctor en Economía y ex funcionario público”.\n\nEn un receso de la audiencia, Duarte salió de la sala con sus abogados defensores guatemaltecos —a su abogado mexicano, Pablo Monsanto de la Mora, sólo se le autorizó ser observador, sin voz ni voto— para deliberar a puertas cerradas en una oficina del mismo recinto del tribunal. En el trayecto pasó otra vez sonriente, como cuando entró a Matamoros.\n\nDe regreso, y otra vez serio, se instaló ante García y anunció la esperada noticia sobre su extradición. Allí se topó con las opciones de allanarse e insertarse en un proceso que, según el tribunal, estaría en México en un plazo “exagerado” de 10 días, u oponerse y pelear para evitar ser extraditado, por lo que siguió en un camino intermedio a esas alternativas.\n\nSu declaración exacta fue: “En este momento no puedo allanarme, sino hasta que llegue la solicitud formal de extradición y sea evaluada por mi", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_124", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "Sorry, St. Louis! But the Rams are moving back to Los Angeles for the start of the 2016 football season. So you'd think that the official website for the team will change from www.stlouisrams.com to www.losangelesrams.com, right?\n\nNot so fast. The losangelesrams.com domain is already registered ... to an owner of a used car dealership and storage facility in Rapid City, South Dakota. Is he about to cash in if the NFL wants the domain name?\n\nBrian Busch, who owns Anytime Auto Sales and Storage, told me he didn't claim the name with visions of getting a big payout. He wasn't doing what's known as cybersquatting -- holding a domain name hostage.\n\nBusch said he first registered the domain way back in 1997 -- two years after the Rams first moved to St. Louis from LA. He said he's probably spent about $1,000 to $2,000 over the past 19 years to keep the domain for this long.\n\nAnd according to the ICANN domain registration database, Busch has the rights to the website address locked up until January 2024.\n\nRelated: How the Rams owner beat the NFL old guard to move back to LA\n\nBusch said it was never his intention to make money from the domain name. After all, the likelihood of the Rams returning to Hollywood didn't really pick up steam until Rams owner Stanley Kroenke bought 60 acres of land in Inglewood, California in 2014.\n\n\"I'm a lifelong Rams fan. I bought it in order to set up a tribute site,\" Busch said. \"I have a signed Roman Gabriel jersey in my office.\" (Gabriel was a quarterback for the Rams from 1962 through 1972 and won the NFL MVP award in 1969.)\n\nBusch, 54, is a South Dakota native. But he said he decided to be a Rams fan in the 1970s because all his friends rooted for the Minnesota Vikings -- the closest NFL team to Rapid City. He wanted to be different.\n\n\"Many people in South Dakota are Vikings fans. I didn't want to be a Vikings fan,\" Busch said. \"The Rams often played the Vikings in the playoffs. I loved their old helmet with the white horns. They looked cool.\"\n\nBusch never wound up developing the website as an homage to those great 1970s teams as planned. It's currently just a parked Web page being hosted by domain registry GoDaddy.\n\n\"I got busy with life, had some kids and it got put on the back burner,\" he said.\n\nBut he's still a huge Rams fan, adding that he's thrilled to see them move back to Los Angeles. Busch even took his two daughters to Minnesota this November to watch them play the Rams.\n\nThe Vikings won that game 21-18 in overtime. Kicker Blair Walsh won it with a 40-yard field goal. (Vikings fans are probably cringing to see \"Blair Walsh\" and \"field goal\" in the same sentence after Sunday's heartbreaking playoff loss.)\n\nSo what now? Busch is expecting a call from the NFL and the Rams -- and he's willing to negotiate.\n\nRelated: NFL approves Rams return to LA\n\nThe NFL was not immediately available for comment. But other domains that the Rams could conceivably use in the City of Angels have already been scooped up as well.\n\nThe larams.com site is registered to a company called Pool.com with an address in Ottawa, according to ICANN domain. A phone call to the number listed for the registrant went to an automated message service.\n\nBut when you go to the site, there is a banner that says \"this domain may be for sale.\"\n\nClicking on that brings you to a website for ParkLogic, a self-described \"doman asset management firm\" in Australia. ParkLogic was not immediately available for comment.\n\nAnd then there's rams.com. That's a site featuring fun facts about the animal. I found out that ram is the \"correct term for the male bighorn sheep\" and that \"a Rocky Mountain bighorn ram's horns can weigh 30 pounds.\"\n\nBut the NFL is going to have to change the domain for the Rams at some point before the start of next season. So Busch is probably the league's best bet to get a new relevant address.\n\n\"I hope we can work out some sort of deal,\" he said, adding that he had no idea what kind of price he'd ask for.\n\nSome context for him though: Major League Baseball bought the rangers.com domain for the Texas Rangers team last year for $375,000! The NFL and Rams billionaire owner Kroenke should have no problem coming up with at least that much.Sorry, St. Louis!

{"id": "sample_6_133", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "al figures have made it to the ban list. George Zimmerman, who gunned down an unarmed Trayvon Martin in 2012, was suspended in 2015. But it was the now oft used term “revenge porn” that ultimately sank his social media bliss, despite previously posting a picture of his murderous handiwork: Martin, lingering lifelessly in the grass.\n\nThe knotted realm of bitchiness and abuse is one thing; but removing political activists from the platform for violating various forms of claimed conduct is an onerous, and in some cases dangerous task. One of the discordant voices of the alt-right movement, and Breitbart’s former tech editor, Milo Yiannopoulos, provides such a case. When does free speech, notably of the insensitive sort, transmute into pure hate speech?\n\nWhere Yiannopoulos ran foul was leading a social media strike on actress Leslie Jones of Ghostbusters fame, a form of character assassination in text. This got him booted off the platform in 2016. Since then, he has been doing a merry dance on the controversial plank, suggesting the possibility that 13-year-olds might have learning sexual relationships with older pedagogues.[3] Such inspirations of antiquity have not gone down well in a social media world less attuned to manuscripts than bleeps.\n\nWhich brings us, at last, to the President himself. Donald Trump has conjured, confected and suggested as few others on Twitter. He has made the social media platform a direct link to the voter in unprecedented ways.\n\nHe has also, according to the creator of House of Cards, Beau Willimon, done enough to be blackballed by the Twitter party. His suggestions go further than most. He argues that the Trump tweet fest poses a “national security threat” which emboldens “our enemies to take advantage of his flagrant shortcomings.”\n\nWillimon’s views are traditionally contractarian, though he notes that Trump is different from any user. “Only one person on @Twitter is President of the United States. That comes with a supreme and unique responsibility.”[4]\n\nTwitter may well connect the globe, but, “That comes with its own responsibility: to do your part in protecting the world.” In accusing former President Barack Obama of having “wire tapped” Trump Tower, with no evidence, the Trump show had generated the grounds for deletion.[5]\n\nMuch of the argument on banning Trump from Twitter is precisely because of his effect. He may be the first instance in history of a verifiable, causally effective figure on the platform. Not all of his less than 140 character notes have been atrocious, let alone distasteful. Amidst the slime lurk bits of Schadenfreude everybody can enjoy. Where will the wrecking ball strike next?\n\nLockheed Martin, to take one example, felt the shareholder pinch at various Trump tweets, most notably on the “tremendous cost and cost overruns” of the F-35 fighter program.[6] Shares in December fell by 2 per cent, surely a joy for anybody against the Military Industrial Complex. Since then, the President has withdrawn that wrecking ball, changing his tune on the F-35 to embrace it for its sudden efficiency on costing.\n\nOther arguments suggest that Twitter, being a private platform, generates its own rules. Free speech can never morph into hate speech; and so on. Going into a bar may well see you served a drink. The publican, however, reserves the right to ignore your custom at any one point for drunkenness or any other number of reasons, not all of them reasonable.\n\nAs shown previously, the puppeteers of the platform are not always predictable. Nor, perhaps, can they be. Besides, shutting off the Trump reality show from a crucial feature of his communications apparatus would be to deprive Planet Earth, not merely of a hysterical show, but a first hand, unvarnished view of what the current President of the United States thinks. That would be even more dangerous.\n\nNotes.\n\n[1] https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/tila-tequila-suspended-from-twitter/\n\n[2] http://rollingout.com/2016/11/23/alabama-teen-suspended-from-twitter-for-whiteface/\n\n[3] http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milo-yiannopoulos-latest-news-paedophilia-breitbart-video-child-abuse-right-wing-sexual-relationship-a7589656.html\n\n[4] http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/house-of-cards-beau-willimon-trump-twitter_us_58bc2c08e4b0b99894182ed0\n\n[5", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_136", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "Israel and the US are set to collaborate in cybersecurity, a senior White House official said at a conference in Tel Aviv Monday.\n\n“I announce today the commencement of an Israeli US bilateral cyber working group,” Thomas Bossert, assistant to the US President Donald Trump for Homeland Security and Counter-terrorism said at the Cyber Week 2017 conference in Tel Aviv Monday.\n\nThe group will strive to defend critical infrastructure against attackers and to track down perpetrators. It will be led by Rob Joyce, the US White House cybersecurity coordinator, and Israel’s Eviatar Matania, director general of the National Cyber Directorate. It will include US and Israeli representatives from various ministries and defense organizations including foreign affairs and justice, and the secret service.\n\nGet The Start-Up Israel's Daily Start-Up by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nThe team will convene this week, Bossert said.\n\n“The meetings this week will focus on a range of cyber issues — critical infrastructure, advanced R&D, international cooperation, and workforce,” Bossert said, adding that these will be the first steps in strengthening bilateral ties in cyber issues.\n\nThe agencies will be… “focused on finding and stopping cyber adversaries before they enter networks, before they reach critical infrastructure and identifying ways to hold bad actors accountable,” Bossert said. “We believe the agility Israel has in developing solutions will resolve in innovative cyber defenses that we can test here and take back to America.”\n\nBossert said that increased cyber defense and deterrence are critical today, in a world in which the cyber threat from nations is growing, and an international consensus needs to be built regarding what is “responsible state behavior.” International norms must be set out and implemented, he said. And those who do not comply with these norms should be punished.\n\n“It is time to consider different approaches,” he said, and the US is seeking to set up bilateral agreements with other partners globally who hold the same values. “There should be consequences for destruction,” he said.\n\nThe cyber sphere “is one of the biggest strategic challenges since 9/11,” he said, “because while physical borders are important, cyberspace knows no boundaries.”\n\n“Nations have the ability to steal sensitive information and data and destroy systems and the trend is heading in the wrong direction,” Bossert said. Destructive attacks are being executed by belligerent nations – North Korea attacked Sony and Iran attacked Saudi Arabia in cyber attacks – and “neither of theses countries have near the sophistication and resources of China and Russia.”\n\nIt was the kind of technology evident in the Iron Dome missile defense system, Bossert said, that the world needs as the threat moves from missiles to malware.\n\nBossert said he was at the conference to talk about cybersecurity, but he was also there to say that “President Trump understands that the United States cannot lessen our engagement in this region… and cannot lessen our support for Israel.”\n\nWhen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his objection to “appeasing Iran” and enabling its nuclear aspirations, he did so at “great professional risk and took political criticism for stating an unpopular truth,” Bossert said. “He was right, he was courageous, the American people agree with him and now he is a partner with President Trump and the Israeli people have a stronger and deeper relationship with the US.”\n\nAt the conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli technology and its cybersecurity leadership are opening doors to the world, breaking down hostilities and the Arab boycott.\n\n“Once it was a disadvantage to say you are from Israel,” Netanyahu said. “Today when you talk about cyber or advanced technologies, it is an advantage. It is advantage to say I am an Israeli company.”\n\n“There used to be a thing called the Arab boycott; that’s dissipating, for many, many reasons: strategic, and the prominence of Israel in the technological field,” he said.\n\nIsrael’s National Cyber Defense Authortity helps its members, who are from government and business organizations, to communicate in a secure way with each other to “not only to respond to attacks but to prevent them,” he said.\n\nEvery month Israel experiences dozens of cyber attacks at a national level, and at “every given moment, including right now, there are probably three to five attacks on a national level that emanate from various sources,” he said.\n\nCooperation between nations is important, Netanyahu said, “because we are better together,” and Israel has become an “attractive target” for cybersecurity investment, garnering about 20 percent of global private cybersecurity investment in 2016.Israel and the US are set to collaborate", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_146", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " when we last left him at the conclusion of the series’ first season, was the House majority whip. “I may lie, cheat and intimidate to get what I want, but at least I get the job done,” Underwood said at the video’s end. “So I hope some of you were taking notes.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRight on cue, the room united in uproarious laughter. We’ve seen something similar these past few days, ever since the second season debuted on Netflix on Friday. But the across-the-aisle affection for the nefarious—even criminal—exploits at the center of the show raise a question: Why has Washington, D.C., been so enthusiastic about the grim, cynical funhouse version of itself that appears in House of Cards?\n\nWhen it comes to anti-heroic dramas, this is more common than you’d think. The advertising industry has eagerly embraced the womanizing, alcoholic Don Draper of Mad Men, and the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico—the setting for Breaking Bad—has turned the locations frequented by Walter White and his compatriots into a cottage tourist industry. It’s true that Essex County, New Jersey took pains to distance itself from the mobsters of HBO’s The Sopranos, but, oddly, nothing of the sort is happening in the image-conscious Capital. In fact, in an odd effort to align itself with the show’s plotlines, the office of Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) actually sent out a press release on Wednesday touting the mention of an initiative similar to one that Slaughter had led (“The reference occurs at the 29:45 mark of the fifth episode, titled ‘Chapter 17’ of season two,” the release helpfully points out).\n\nShouldn’t this surprise us? Why would a town so careful about presentation so gleefully embrace a show that treats politicians as either imbecilic or deeply corrupt, and treats most established journalists as cynical, selfishly motivated and malleable? For a time, the popularity of House of Cards in the District was something of an open secret; a BuzzFeed article published two weeks after the show’s first-season premiere reported that “aides who gushed about the show off the record subsequently refused to be interviewed […] fearing it might reflect poorly on their bosses or themselves.” Mike Long, the press secretary for real-life House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, took to Twitter to clarify that his boss had nothing in common with Frank Underwood.\n\nSince then, Hill staffers, journalists and politicians alike all seemed to finish watching the first season and something began to change. The less salient aspects of the show collapsed under the weight of a simple truth: House of Cards makes Washington and its two wonkiest industries—journalism and politics—look really cool, even as it implicitly attacks them at their very roots.\n\nHouse of Newt Watching with the Gingriches Curious about how the former House speaker and his wife, a former Hill staffer, are reacting to the new season of House of Cards? Yeah, so were we. Here are the takeaways, as reported by the Gingriches: 1. “Kevin Spacey is brilliant and his performance alone would justify the series. The script is good, the other actors are solid, but Spacey is brilliant.” 2. [Spoiler alert!] “Frank Underwood is a far more aggressive vice president than Joe Biden.” 3. “Frank Underwood runs the Senate more ruthlessly than Harry Reid (actually in a style reminiscent of Speaker Tom Reed).” 4. “Tea parties should have viewing parties. House of Cards could be a great recruiting tool.” 5. “Claire Underwood is a study in ruthless professionalism.” 6. “Riding the Metro is a little scarier now. House of Cards reminds us to watch our backs while waiting for the train.” 7. “As Republicans we are happy that our party is portrayed as somewhat stubborn and a challenge to manage, while Democrats are shown as corrupt, conniving, and viciously ambitious. Maybe House of Cards is actually a reality show.”\n\nOver the past year, House of Cards’s political accolades have continued to amass. In December, the show received an endorsement from no less than President Barack Obama, who asked Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, on a visit to the White House, if he’d brought along advance copies of the show’s second season. “I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,” the president joked. “It’s true. I like Kevin Spacey. Man, this guy’s getting a lot of stuff done.”\n\nThe lines have only gotten blurrier from there.

Tucker praised the episode, and said, \"With jokes raining down like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves.\"[12] Ramsey Isler of IGN said it was fun to identify all the references to past South Park moments, but felt \"200\" itself didn't stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn't very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode.[10] The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how South Park had been more original in early episodes, but now had \"morph[ed] into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news\".[6]\n\nDouglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph said of the episode, \"I can't recommend it enough\",[15] and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, \"They make the point about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen.\"[15] Amy Duncan of Metro said it \"certainly was an episode to remember\". Duncan praised the story, which she said \"develops with [South Park's] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks\".[65] Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode \"came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season\". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story in addition to the throwback references.[66] Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't \"pull any punches\". Zaino said the episode has \"a wonderful sense of the absurd\", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet.[7]\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group, said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in \"200\", but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show. The group's spokesman, Ibrahim Hooper, said, \"People are pretty tired of this whole 'Let's insult the prophet Muhammad thing.'\"[67]\n\nRevolution Muslim entry [ edit ]\n\nWe have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them. Abu Talhah al Amrikee[12]\n\nThe website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they \"will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.\" Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by an Islamist in 2004 for making a short documentary on the violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, Zachary Adam Chesser (who prefers to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee),[68] said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.\n\nThe entry included audio clips of a sermon by al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki, calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad, saying, \"Harming Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that.\"[69][70] It also included a link to a 2009 Huffington Post article that gave details of Stone and Parker's mansion in Colorado,[70] and images of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an activist writer and critic of Islam, who lives in permanent security protection because of threats.[71] Comedy Central declined to comment on the post.[70] Before writing the Revolution Muslim post, Chesser wrote an April 15 entry on his Twitter page: \"May Allah kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker and burn them in Hell for all eternity. They insult our prophets Muhammad, Jesus, and Moses.\"[67] Chesser was subsequently sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for this and other offenses.\n\nDespite Chesser's statements that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat.[72][73][74", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_6_149", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " defeat them. They are lazy, but they are also severely incompetent.\n\nLast week, Donald Trump asserted that Hillary Clinton and Obama “founded ISIS.” Trump didn’t literally mean they sat down and discussed how to create this group from scratch–or did he?\n\nTrump’s statement is 100% accurate, and a leaked memo from the State Department proves it to be true!\n\nA month ago, it was released that Hillary Clinton received classified intelligence stating that Obama was supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), the group that changed their name to ISIS. So, Obama is the founder of ISIS, and Hillary quickly became the co-captain of this dangerous team in 2012.\n\nThe leaked memo made it abundantly clear that AQI used Muhammad Al Adnani as their spokesman. Guess what, he is now the spokesman for ISIS. Barack Hussein Obama was literally paying them money! This is not even close to a joke or a theory. The leaked memo proves it to be factual.\n\nObama’s plan was to support the terrorist group until they overthrew Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad. Toppling dictators and supporting terrorist groups has NEVER worked, but Hillary continues to think so. She was a heavy proponent of this idea. Keep that point in mind.\n\nIn an August 2012 “SECRET” classified memo made its way to Hillary Clinton AND Obama.\n\nFarrell confirmed that the report was read by Hillary Clinton via the recipient marking “RUEHC/SECSTATE WASHINGTON DC.”\n\nThe document is very lengthy and some portions are still classified, so we pieced together certain aspects to show the exact memo Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama saw.\n\nTHE GENERAL SITUATION: A. THE SALAFIST, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, AND AQI ARE THE MAJOR FORCES DRIVING THE INSURGENCY IN SYRIA. B. THE WEST, GULF COUNTRIES, AND TURKEY SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION; WHILE RUSSIA, CHINA, AND IRAN SUPPORT THE REGIME.\n\nThis report primarily discusses the background of AQI, their methods, capabilities, and that they use the spokesman of the Islamic State of Iraq Muhammad Al Adnani. Clearly there are already signs of bad things, but Hillary and Obama push even harder on this.\n\nThe report continues:\n\nAL QAEDA – IRAQ (AQI): A. AQI IS FAMILIAR WITH SYRIA. AQI TRAINED IN SYRIA AND THEN INFILTRATED INTO IRAQ. B. AQI SUPPORTED THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION FROM THE BEGINNING, BOTH IDEOLOGICALLY AND THROUGH THE MEDIA. AQI DECLARED ITS OPPOSITION OF ASSAD’S GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT CONSIDERED IT A SECTARIAN REGIME TARGETING SUNNIS.\n\nThe intelligence report from 2012 also predicts that segments of Al Adnani’s AQI group will break off and join ISIS, making them much stronger:\n\nTHIS CREATES THE IDEAL ATMOSPHERE FOR AQI TO RETURN TO ITS OLD POCKETS IN MOSUL AND RAMADI, AND WILL PROVIDE A RENEWED MOMENTUM UNDER THE PRESUMPTION OF UNIFYING THE JIHAD AMONG SUNNI IRAQ AND SYRIA, AND THE REST OF THE SUNNIS IN THE ARAB WORLD AGAINST WHAT IT CONSIDERS ONE ENEMY, THE DISSENTERS. ISI COULD ALSO DECLARE AN ISLAMIC STATE THROUGH ITS UNION WITH OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, WHICH WILL CREATE GRAVE DANGER IN REGARDS TO UNIFYING IRAQ AND THE PROTECTION OF ITS TERRITORY.\n\nRemember when American Kayla Mueller was taken hostage by ISIS and was kept as a sex slave for ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi? Had ISIS been destroyed from the beginning like a leaked memo warned, this atrocity wouldn’t have happen to an American!\n\nBoth Obama and Hillary Clinton knew ISIS was going to carry out all of the plans in all of the locations before it happened. Did they stop them? No.\n\nThis memo leaked proves Obama and Hillary saw this information in 2012, which was just before ISIS rose to their prominence in 2014. So, yes, Mr. Trump, they are the founders of ISIS. They paid them and allowed them to do whatever they wanted in the Middle East.\n\nHere is a former Obama Pentagon official admitting Trump is right:\n\nThis report accurately predicted that ISIS would take over Mosul, Raqqa, and Ramadan.

{"id": "sample_6_154", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " labeling myself publicly for the first time.\n\nThere are three labels that I have decided to associate myself with. I will list the labels that I have chosen, the reasons I have chosen them and most importantly, what that label means to me. As I said before, others outside these groups may consider these labels differently, so I will explain what that means from my perspective.\n\nFirstly, I am an atheist. As an atheist I do not believe in a God or Gods. I do not believe in Zeus, Thor, Apollo, Ra, Jesus or God the Father. I do not believe that there is a being who is watching over me, blessing me or judging my behavior. I also do not believe that the universe was created by a consciousness. That is all that being an atheist means. It doesn’t mean that I am a devil worshiper. It doesn’t mean that I immoral. It doesn’t mean that I eat babies. All it means is that I do not believe in any form of a God or Gods.\n\nSecond, I am a materialist. A materialist sees reality as the physical matter of which is it composed. Thought, feelings and will can all be defined in terms of matter and physical phenomena. I am a collection of the nerve impulses and synapses in my brain responding to physical stimuli. I do not believe in a soul, a spirit or a part of myself that is not my physical body. I am my body and when I die my brain will no longer send those impulses and I will cease to be.\n\nThird, I am a humanist. A humanist is someone who believes that life is fragile and that it matters. That each individual who is lucky enough to have one has the rights to have a good one. It is amazing that we exist at all and we should go out of our way to help those in need, because this is the only life that we get. Everyone who has one has a fundamental right to have the opportunity of a pleasant one. Those who have enough to survive, or who have excess, should give and donate to those who do not, so that they may experience the basic rights and necessities of life to survive and be happy.\n\nThis is who I am and how I choose to define myself. I was not raised with these ideals, but developed them over time after years of observation and thought. I used to be religious. I enjoyed spending time with like-minded individuals who supported my beliefs, but I have left that behind me and found a new identity. One that I love and that makes me happier than I was before.\n\nMy goal with this blog is to share my journey from being a Mormon to becoming an atheist, why I changed my ways of thinking and how I feel now. I will be sharing a lot of scientific principles and discoveries that helped me to make my decisions, along with future discoveries that reinforce those beliefs and expand my knowledge of this fascinating universe that we live in.\n\nI will be talking a lot about how atheists are perceived in the U.S. and how I have lost friends because of my decisions. I will criticize religion. I will post anti-religious ideas and images. I do this not to anger those who have those beliefs or to persecute them, but because being critical is part of life and especially science. Any group that says not to doubt, not to seek other sources or think about alternative views is destructive to the human experience. Religion gives answers and says not to doubt them. Science asks questions and doubts the answers until the evidence can be tested, retested, verified and upheld, and can even then be refuted and tossed out when further discoveries are made.\n\nAs will become the norm, I will end these blogs with a quote or a comic. I will do both for my first.\n\n“I am not an atheist because I am mad at your god. I am not an atheist because I love sin. I am not an atheist because I don’t want to answer to authority. I am an atheist because I sought the truth about reality. I have accepted nature and my place in the universe. I will live and I will die. I wish to leave this world knowing that I did my best. I hope our descendants inherit a world that can sustain them.” – Mike Autrey\n\nI had to add a second quote to fit in with my last point.\n\n“Truth does not ask to be believed. It asks to be tested. Scientists do not join hands every Saturday or Sunday and sing, ‘Yes. Gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I will be strong! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down, down, down. Amen!’ If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about the concept.” – Dan Barker\n\nFinally, a comic.\n\nThanks for reading!

We believe that partisanship…\n\nAnd we believe our job is to afflict the comfortable leadership of both parties – to speak truth to whichever POWER needs to hear it.\n\nOf course, those criticizing us might be suggesting we have some sympathies with the GOP.

I rage against cuts that don’t cut\n\nThe Republican-controlled House and Democrat-run Senate haven’t really “cut” anything. One party is lying about false accomplishments, while the other is hysterical about something that doesn’t even exist. Do you want real cuts?\n\nRetweet: http://twitter.com/#!/DDCDispatch/status/108630458501312512\n\n3. Statism means always having to pay other people’s bills\n\nDid the politicians steal $103 million from you so that other people could get broadband cable? Tell them to stop robbing Peter to pay Paul, and robbing you to pay both of them!\n\nRetweet: http://twitter.com/#!/DDCDispatch/status/108631061394755584\n\n4. Patriot Act Deployed Against Wikileaks\n\nEven we know this is a HERESY! You might disagree. The State hates those who expose wrongdoing, and seeks to silence, even punish them. But what Republican leader would say this? Heck, what Democrat leader is defending the free press in this instance? We think the politicians need to hear from you about this. We hope you agree.\n\nRetweet: http://twitter.com/#!/DDCDispatch/status/108631725927702528\n\nAnd, to the people who’ve written us, or thought of writing us, saying we’re in the Koch brother’s pockets…\n\nDownsize DC has never solicited Koch help\n\nThe brothers have never given Downsize DC a dime\n\nAnd, borrowing from the list above, you’ve suspended deep thought, lack imagination, and bear a closed mind\n\nWe’re doing what we’ve done from day one: We’re turning to everyday people like you who will stand with us because we’ll speak the hard truth, even when it’s inconvenient.\n\nTaking a stand for the right thing is not easy, and our ability to keep doing it requires your help. The truth is, the stands we take often cost us support. So please help us finish off this month with your financial endorsement.\n\nOh, and if the Koch brothers want to send us a check, we’ll gladly cash it and keep doing the work we’re doing — just more of it.\n\nJim Babka\n\nPresident\n\nDownsizeDC.org, Inc.\n\ncommentsQuote of the Day: “Opposing the status quo generates a cloak of media invisibility regardless of party or ideology.” – Steve Dasbach, co-founder, DownsizeDC.org\n\nLately, we’ve gotten a lot of messages accusing us of being mean-spirited Republicans.

(Bridgette Watson/CBC)\n\nThe death will need to be registered with The British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency, where a disposition permit will be issued to confirm where the body will be buried, or cremated.\n\nIf a funeral home is not moving the body, then a private transport permit must be applied for through Consumer Protection BC. Without this form, transporting a body violates the Funeral Services Act.\n\nA death doula can also teach people how to care for a dead body. They are not registered funeral providers and cannot be paid to wash a body, but they can provide instruction and support.\n\nYou can never have too much ice\n\nDead bodies need to be kept cool. It is essential to have ice packs on hand to place around the vital organs of a person after they pass.\n\nPashta MaryMoon is a death doula who helps families prepare for home funerals. She said people need to be prepared for the effects of rigor mortis.\n\n\"You often see in movies somebody dies and their eyes are open and then they just pass their hands over top of the eyelids and they shut,\" said MaryMoon, who explained this is not normally the case in real life.\n\nMaryMoon's DIY tips include using sandwich bags of rice to weigh down eyelids. She also recommends using a headscarf to secure the corpse's jaw closed before rigor mortis sets in.\n\nThe body can be washed with essential oils that kill bacteria, but Charlotte Poncelet, executive director of the BC Funeral Association said it is important to disclose medical history if you are planning a home funeral.\n\nThis will protect body handlers from being unknowingly exposed to hepatitis or other health risks.\n\nBlending traditions\n\nNot everyone wants to wash their own dead.\n\nNgaio Davis is an independent Vancouver funeral director. She suggests talking to your loved ones well in advance and planning according to personal comfort levels.\n\n\"I would like to see things really open up and just be a blending,\" said Davis. \"It doesn't have to be flaky, it doesn't have to be stiff and funeral direct-y, it can be just what you need.\"\n\nWith files from CBC Radio One's On The CoastDIY Funerals: Rite at Home is a five-part radio series exploring home funerals.

{"id": "sample_6_170", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "THE romance between Ukraine and the European Union is full of unmet expectations. Ukraine wants commitment from the EU; the EU wants proof that Ukraine has really changed. When EU officials visited Kiev on April 27th for a joint summit, they snubbed Ukraine’s requests for a peacekeeping force in the Donbas, for additional military aid and for visa-free travel. Western financial assistance is trickling in, but Ukraine wants more. “Greece already received $300 billion, with no war, with no Russian tanks,” Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the prime minister, said after the summit. Ukraine, he complained, has received just one-tenth as much.\n\nThe EU says help will come, but only after reforms. “You keep reforming, we keep supporting,” said the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker. European leaders want to see Ukraine implement its new laws and decentralise governance, as agreed in the Minsk peace plan. Some worry that failure to do this will invite Russia to relaunch the war. Already violence is ticking up near the rebel capital of Donetsk and the Ukrainian-held port of Mariupol.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nPetro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, takes umbrage at charges that reforms are lagging. Lawmakers recently passed legislation to break up gas monopolies, increase energy-sector competition, and unbundle the state gas conglomerate Naftogaz, a fiscal black hole. Last month Mr Poroshenko picked a head for the newly created National Anti-Corruption Bureau.\n\nYet the biggest test will be the struggle against Ukraine’s oligarchs. The latest battle pits the state against the country’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov. The government wants to end Mr Akhmetov’s coal and electricity monopolies, and may let his holding company, DTEK, go bankrupt. Coal miners have taken to Kiev’s streets, banging their helmets and calling for the energy minister to resign. Mustafa Nayyem, a reformist legislator, published leaked documents allegedly issued by DTEK that set out plans to engineer protests. DTEK said it “did not know the source of the documents”, but did not deny that they were genuine.\n\nFollowing the miners’ march, Mr Poroshenko vowed that those who put pressure on the state “will get their knuckles rapped”. In a column in the Guardian, a British newspaper, Mr Poroshenko boasted of taking down Ihor Kolomoisky, an oligarch forced to resign as a regional governor last month after he deployed armed guards to protect his oil-industry assets from government reforms. But Europe does not want de-oligarchisation to become a game of whack-a-mole led by Mr Poroshenko, who is himself an oligarch. It wants Ukraine systematically to transform the oligarchs’ empires into law-abiding big businesses. Until that happens, Ukraine may feel itself to be in a relationship with the EU, one that could even lead towards membership—but the EU will respond that things are complicated.THE romance between Ukraine and the European Union is full of unmet expectations. Ukraine wants commitment from the EU; the EU wants proof that Ukraine has really changed. When EU officials visited Kiev on April 27th for a joint summit, they snubbed Ukraine’s requests for a peacekeeping force in the Donbas, for additional military aid and for visa-free travel. Western financial assistance is trickling in, but Ukraine wants more. “Greece already received $300 billion, with no war, with no Russian tanks,” Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the prime minister, said after the summit. Ukraine, he complained, has received just one-tenth as much.\n\nThe EU says help will come, but only after reforms. “You keep reforming, we keep supporting,” said the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker. European leaders want to see Ukraine implement its new laws and decentralise governance, as agreed in the Minsk peace plan. Some worry that failure to do this will invite Russia to relaunch the war. Already violence is ticking up near the rebel capital of Donetsk and the Ukrainian-held port of Mariupol.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nPetro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president, takes umbrage at charges that reforms are lagging. Lawmakers recently passed legislation to break up gas monopolies, increase energy-sector competition, and unbundle the state gas conglomerate Naftogaz, a fiscal black hole. Last month Mr Poroshenko picked a head for the newly created National Anti-Corruption Bureau.\n\nYet the biggest test will", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_176", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "According to some of the most popular dating advice books, one of the keys to attracting a romantic partner is to take the somewhat counterintuitive step of pretending like you aren’t interested in the other person. But does this tactic really work? Can “playing hard to get” really help you score a date? According to a new set of studies published in the European Journal of Personality, it would appear so.\n\nIn one of these studies, researchers gave 270 heterosexual college students three dating profiles that were equivalent in terms of attractiveness, age, and background information [1]. The only thing that differed was the likelihood that the person would go out with someone they had just met (i.e., the target was described as having either low, intermediate, or high availability). Participants were asked to choose which person they would be most likely to have casual sex with, which one they would be most likely to date, and which one they would be most likely to start a romantic relationship with. Participants could choose the same or different persons for each option.\n\nWhen it came to casual sex, both men and women overwhelming preferred the highly available target. So, if you’re hoping to get lucky, playing hard to get is not particularly advantageous. However, when it came to dating and starting a romantic relationship, both men and women preferred the target with intermediate availability. So, if you’re looking for love, playing at least a little hard to get seems advisable.\n\nIn another study, the researchers gave heterosexual college student participants photos of equally attractive targets that again varied in perceived availability (low, intermediate, or high). Participants were asked what kind of restaurant they would take this person to (fast food, casual, or fine dining) and how much money they would be willing to spend on the other person’s dinner.\n\nIn this case, the low availability targets won hands down. Both men and women reported that they would take the low availability target to a fancier restaurant, as well as spend more money on this person. Specifically, the low availability target was worth $44.45 on average, compared to $34.99 and $33.10 for the intermediate and high availability targets, respectively. In other words, playing hard to get may lead your date to spring for a better meal.\n\nOne other question this set of studies sought to answer is how people play hard to get. To answer this, the researchers asked a sample of men and women whether they have ever played hard to get and, if so, how they accomplished this. Women reported playing hard to get more often than did men. In addition, the two most commonly reported tactics were acting confident and talking to other people, with men and women being equally likely to say that they had done these specific things before. However, several other reasons were reported, and some important sex differences emerged. Specifically, women were more likely than men to say that they do things like not calling, not talking much, and keeping busy. In contrast, men were more likely than women to report things like “saying all the right things but not calling,” “acting snotty or rude,” and “treating others like sh*t.” Fortunately, those last two were rated as occurring with very low frequency. I should also mention that just because at least a few people reported doing these behaviors, it does not necessarily mean that they work!\n\nOf course, these findings are limited in that they only looked at college students and, further, all participants were heterosexual. However, the results suggest that if you're looking for casual sex, being more available will make you more successful--but if you're looking for love, playing hard to get is the better strategy. In other words, when it comes to love, the old adage rings true: \"why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\"\n\nWant to learn more about The Psychology of Human Sexuality?

Visit discourse.pythonpodcast.com for your opportunity to find out about upcoming guests, suggest questions, and propose show ideas.\n\nYour host as usual is Tobias Macey and today I’m interviewing Dave Vandenbout about SKIDL, a library for designing and validating circuit layouts.\n\nInterview\n\nIntroductions\n\nHow did you get introduced to Python?\n\nCan you describe what SKIDL is and the problem that you were trying to solve when you first started it?\n\nMost of my experience designing circuits has been done using a graphical tool. If you are using Python for the entire layout does it become difficult to understand the overall circuit without the visual representation? Is there a way to generate a circuit diagram from the SKIDL code for a visual reference?\n\nIt seems that there is a substantial amount of electrical knowledge required to be able to design and build schematics in code. For someone who is more of a hobbyist or is just starting to work with circuit design are there any facilities of SKIDL to assist with that understanding?\n\nWhat does the testing and validation process of a generated circuit look like?\n\nWhat does the internal architecture of SKIDL look like and what are some of the biggest challenges that you have faced while building it?\n\nFor the generated netlist does SKIDL take into account voltage losses due to the lengths of the traces in the final PCB and does it have any facilities to optimize the overall layout for space and efficiency?\n\nSometimes a circuit board is meant to be accessible for maintenance or even display purposes. Is it possible to specify the arrangement of components to make them more aesthetically pleasing or to space them so that they are easier to access physical interface ports (e.g. GPIO pins or I2C buses)?\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or surprising uses of SKIDL that you have seen?\n\nKeep In Touch\n\nPicks\n\nTobias Samsonite Tectonic Backpack\n\nDave Ball 4 by Jim Bouton\n\nLinks\n\nThe intro and outro music is from Requiem for a Fish The Freak Fandango Orchestra / CC BY-SASummary\n\nAs circuits and electronic components become more complex, visual circuit building tools are more difficult to use effectively.

There is no mention of any other former officials being held accountable for past failures, some of whom are still employed by the Department of Interior or other Federal agencies.\n\nThe report fails to mention that the Firearms Custodian has had little to no access to the computer system used to track these government owned firearms other than viewing capability.

Amnesty's Moscow office was \"inspected\" by prosecutors and tax inspectors on 25 March.\n\nThe first organisation to face legal proceedings is a group named Golos – or \"voice\" in Russian – which played a prominent role in organising election monitoring and reporting fraud in the vote which saw Mr Putin re-elected.\n\nIn several cases the inspectors demanded to go through computers or emails. In one case, officials demanded that an organisation prove that its staff had been vaccinated for smallpox, and in another the officials asked for chest X-rays of staff to ensure they did not have tuberculosis.\n\n\"The government claims the inspections are routine, but they clearly are not,\" said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at HRW.\n\n\"The campaign is unprecedented in its scope and scale, and seems clearly aimed at intimidating and marginalising civil society groups. This inspection campaign can potentially be used to force some groups to end advocacy work, or to close them down.\"\n\nAnother law, adopted in December, essentially banned funding emanating from the United States for \"political\" activity by non-governmental organisations, and bans groups whose work is \"directed against Russia's interests.\"\n\nA third law, the treason law, expands the legal definition of treason in ways that could criminalise involvement in raising awareness of human rights.\n\nThe publication of the reports comes at a time of mounting pressure for Mr Putin.\n\nOn Wednesday – the same day the report was launched in Moscow – a high-profile critic of the president went on trial for what he said were trumped-up charges.\n\nAlexei Navalny, 36, told a court in the city of Kirov that they should throw out the charges of stealing from a timber firm.\n\nMr Navalny has suggested that Mr Putin ordered the trial to stop his criticism of \"swindlers and thieves\" in government and sideline him as a potential presidential rival.\n\n\"The case absolutely cannot be tried in court in its current form,\" the anti-corruption campaigner said, after Judge Sergei Blinov ordered a recess to consider his plea to send the case back to state prosecutors.\n\nMr Navalny, who organised the biggest protests since Mr Putin rose to power 13 years ago, is accused of stealing 16 million roubles (£335,000) from a timber firm in Kirov that he was advising in 2009.\n\n\"It's raw, it's tendentious, there are different numbers cited everywhere, different amounts of timber are mentioned, and so on.\"\n\nHe also insisted his innocence would be apparent even if he was convicted.\n\n\"At the end of the trial, we will certainly win. I'm sure that a lack of guilt will be established.\n\n\"Even if it is not formally acknowledged by the court, it will be clear for everyone who attends the trial.\"Mr Putin , who was re-elected as president almost a year ago, stands accused of bringing in new laws to stifle criticism of his regime and adapting existing laws to silence dissent.\n\n\"The Russian government has unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country's post-Soviet history,\" the HRW report states.\n\n\"The authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws, harassed, intimidated and in several case imprisoned political activists, interfered in the work of NGOs and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies.\"\n\nIn a move that Amnesty described as \"deliberately reminiscent of the Cold War,\" Mr Putin has brought in a new law which requires any organisation that receives funding from abroad to describe themselves as \"foreign agents\" if they are considered to be involved in undefined \"political activities\".\n\nSince the start of the year, the Russian authorities have carried out more than 200 inspections of organisations campaigning to protect human rights.

{"id": "sample_6_197", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " policy is.\n\nBURNETT: In fact, the directive restates what's already in the policy handbook: officers may use deadly force only when necessary - that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person. During a visit earlier this month I made to the Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, New Mexico, training supervisor Brian Yarges said the circumstances of every confrontation are different.\n\nBRIAN YARGES: All that is based on, as far as when they would draw a weapon and when they would use force, is based off of officer's perception, is based off of the threat that they are presented with, severity of the crime and the actions of the subject.\n\nBURNETT: I went there to interview the director and his deputy about the academy's evolving use-of-force training, but neither was permitted to speak to me on the record. So, I asked Yarges to go a level deeper, to get more insight into what the academy teaches young trainees about when to use deadly force or when to use non-lethal force, such as pepper spray or batons. This is the exchange that ensued with the agency's public affairs person, who oversaw my visit.\n\nWhat are the hierarchy of responses to rock throwers...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We're not going to...\n\nBURNETT: ...what is first action, second action or...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: ...discuss the hierarchy or - OK. That's it. That's it.\n\nBURNETT: I was then escorted out of the Border Patrol training academy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: That's it.\n\nBURNETT: Transparency is another problem the Border Patrol needs to work on. Again, union Vice President Shawn Moran whose member-agents are part of the parent agency, CBP, Customs and Border Protection.\n\nMORAN: You know, I sat on a panel last week, and I said that CBP has a legacy of secrecy. And I think that CBP can do a lot to alleviate the concerns by opening up the books and showing what is going on out there. And I think people would accept why agents had to use force if they knew more facts about these incidents.\n\nBURNETT: Both the new Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske have pledged to make the agency more transparency. To that end, it made public a redacted copy of its use-of-force policy handbook. But they have much more work to do. An investigation by Homeland Security's inspector general urged the Border Patrol to better train agents in use of force and track citizen complaints better. Last year, the ACLU released its own list of 79 recommendations to bring Customs and Border Protection procedures more in line with the best practices of metro police departments. For instance, in most cities, when a police officer kills a citizen, a commander holds a press conference, the officer is named, he's often put on administration leave and the victim's family is updated on the progress of the investigation. When the Border Patrol kills someone, none of that happens. Chris Rickerd is policy counsel with the ACLU.\n\nCHRIS RICKERD: CBP has its own responsibility to make clear what in the fatal and other use-of-force incidents it does in terms of putting officers on administrative leave and investigating and following up on these matters. That's a lot more transparent in urban police departments.\n\nBURNETT: One of the special dangers faced by border agents that's different from a city cop is rock throwing. Mexicans throw projectiles from their side of the border at uniformed agents on the U.S. side, and the agents have to decide what to do - take cover, leave the area or use force. Since 2010, by the agency's count, officers have been assaulted with rocks 1,713 times. They have responded with deadly force 43 times, causing 10 deaths. One of the dead was Jose Antonio Elena. The 16-year-old high school student was shot and killed on a sidewalk in Nogales, Sonora by a border officer in October of 2012. The 911 caller describes an officer shooting from the Arizona side into Mexico.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Spanish spoken)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Spanish spoken)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Spanish spoken)\n\nBURNETT: Federal agents were reportedly being pelted with rocks when at least one of them fired through the international fence and struck Jose Antonio, who, witnesses say, was not throwing rocks and was not armed. The Mexican autopsy report describes 10 bullet wounds - six of them in his back. Through a translator is his 64-year-old grandmother, Taide Elena.\n\nTA", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_199", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " Hardball, Countdown, and Rachel Maddow – devoted substantial coverage to the dirty tricks and voter suppression efforts of McCain’s campaign. The reporting is critically important. But, in the end, it probably helped McCain simply by dropping the economy as THE STORY.\n\nFOXnews, of course, last week devoted a good deal of its daily reporting to ACORN. \"Anything But the Economy\" should be the phony news outlet’s new motto. You want to know the McCain message strategy? Watch FOX. They execute campaign orders with the scary discipline of practiced propagandists.\n\nBut even smart, open-minded or progressive media have difficulty focusing on more than one thing at one time. They want THE STORY. And post-debate last week, THE STORY was, in some order or other, McCain campaign dirty tricks (racist robocalls), Republican efforts to keep American citizens from voting, McCain’s poor debate performance, electoral college predictions, etc.\n\nThe stock market was up slightly by the end of the week, and the outrages of the McCain campaign stole the shows. They were enough to make it less than THE STORY. And that’s helped McCain, if only by a small amount. Which means there’s no incentive for the McCain camp to reign in their extremist messaging.\n\nThis presents the Obama campaign with a dilemma. Take the focus off the economy, and McCain will gain. Leave the anti-democratic and racist tactics of the McCain campaign unaddressed, and McCain will gain.\n\nThis time, though, the Obama campaign has something no Democratic campaign has had in recent presidential cycles: a late lead with a cushion. Its state-by-state advantage in the contest for electoral votes means it can concede a brief, short-term advantage to McCain by doing some things that diminish the reporting of economic news. Very, very important things. Like demanding that a special prosecutor investigate the Department of Justice’s raw, illegal and undemocratic investigation-by-press-leak of ACORN.\n\nI’m going to take advantage of the cushion to make a simple point about the authoritarian and democracy-threatening voter suppression efforts of the Right.\n\nI’m aware that when McCain made his preposterous \"destroying the fabric of democracy\" claim against ACORN in last week’s debate, he knew what he was doing. He was distracting voters from the economic distress. And he was stealing the language of condemnation aimed by Obama and others at McCain’s voter suppression schemes. As bad as the McCain campaign has been, it’s not always stupid. The \"fabric of democracy\" remark was used tactically to diminish the impact of any coverage the voter suppression efforts might receive. Voters will be confused about just who is ripping said fabric.\n\nI’m aware of McCain’s little play, but I don’t care. McCain’s tactical prophylactic is thin. So here’s my simple point:\n\nIn a democracy, voter suppression should be made a high crime on a level with treason.\n\nIn fact, I don’t think a system can even be called a democracy unless it treats as a great and terrible crime the suppression, intimidation or exclusion of citizens from elections. When voter exclusion is tolerated, voting can become little more than a pretty curtain drawn across the muscled efforts of authority to have its way no matter what the citizenry might prefer.\n\nBut in America, exclusion has a cultural and political advantage over inclusion. It took 140-plus years for women to earn the franchise. It was 1965 before formal and legal barriers to African-American participation in elections were removed by the Voting Rights Act. Demonizing a group by color, religion, geography or even political preference and then taking steps to keep the demonized group from voting – where’s the news? It’s been done since the founding of the nation.\n\nHow people of the Right manage to square their avowed love of democracy with actions that subvert it isn’t really that big a mystery. In the conservative worldview, only certain people – Calvinists knew them as the Elect – should be regarded as full citizens. The non-Elect aren’t full citizens because they are less favored by God or the town fathers. In authoritarian minds, suppressing the voting rights of their neighbors becomes essential to protecting legitimate authority within a democracy. The successful disenfranchising of the non-Elect is then taken as a sign that God or more earthly authority looks down upon the victims of suppression. It’s a neat little self-justifying merry-go-round of logic.\n\nTo all you conservatives busy caging votes, passing along voter purge lists, contributing money to pay for racist robocalls, hiring private-duty cops to patrol the polls to intimidate would-be voters, rigging voting machines and on and one, I say this: you belong", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

It's everything I was hoping for,\" says Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay.\n\nThe barbecue took place instead of a planned protest for Sunday night.\n\nRamsay suggested the event to community leaders following a Black Lives Matter protest in the city last week.\n\nRamsay had said the barbecue was an opportunity for citizens and police to be introduced and to have positive interaction. Nearly 400 people pledged their intention to attend the event with an RSVP. More than double that amount attended.\n\nLeading up to the barbecue, there was a lot of positive support in response to the event on social media. People at the barbecue said it is the right way to respond to the unrest going on across the country.\n\nThe Wichita Police Department brought the burgers and grilled up and served food.

Some in attendance did take this opportunity to voice frustrations.\n\nOne man says he viewed the cookout as an attempt to take attention away from real cause of the tension between some citizens and police.\n\nRamsay says his department is committed to making things better.\n\n\"This isn't something we're going to change overnight or tonight,\" he says. \"It's just going to take continual effort on everybody's part. And work on policy changes, relationships. And that's what's going to get to the heart of the issues.\"There was unity in Wichita Sunday night after a tense week for activists and law enforcement in the community, as well as nationwide.\n\nSunday night's event in Wichita's McAdams Park drew a crowd of nearly 1,000 people.

(0:51)\n\nAfter questioning in December the logic of taking a pay cut from his $19.9 million cap number next season, defensive end Mario Williams has changed his tone on the issue.\n\nOn Wednesday, he told ESPN NFL Insider Josina Anderson that \"it's bigger than just the numbers\" and he would be open to listening to the Buffalo Bills about reducing his pay.\n\nThe Bills have the NFL's tightest salary-cap situation this offseason.\n\n\"I would love to have him back, but we'll see how realistic that is,\" coach Rex Ryan said Wednesday.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in December, citing a person with direct knowledge of discussions, that the Bills would release Williams this offseason. The Bills can save $12.9 million by releasing him.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, it all depends on what is happening,\" Williams told Anderson. \"My thing is this: Obviously, I've had big contracts, but once you get on a team and you get around the guys, it becomes family. The guys on defense, we laugh and talk about anything. We do a bunch of stuff together, and off the field, obviously. It's bigger than just numbers.\n\n\"But at the same time, as far as what you said about [a pay cut] being feasible, a [salary-cap] crunch is a crunch. Obviously there's two great players on the other side of the ball [pending free-agent left tackle Cordy Glenn and left guard Richie Incognito] that need to be back. Like you said, I'm not an accountant, either. I don't even know how you can go about making it where it makes at least some type of sense.\n\n\"That's not what I do, so that's why I don't even worry about it.\"\n\nMario Williams says he's willing to listen to the Bills about taking a pay cut to stay and is willing to meeting coaches halfway about his role in the defense. Stephen Pond/Getty Images\n\nWilliams, who is entering the fifth year of a six-year, $100 million deal he signed in 2012, has the second-highest cap number of any NFL defensive player next season. While the NFL has yet to determine its 2016 salary cap, ESPN Stats & Information projects the Bills to be about $1 million over their projected salary cap, making them the only team that must shed salary before the 2016 league year opens March 9.\n\nAsked after the Bills' Dec. 20 loss to the Washington Redskins if he would be open to taking a pay cut, Williams said, \"If this is the turnout of our defense, how does that even sound right?\"\n\nWilliams, 31, recorded 5.0 sacks this season, the lowest output of his career since his 4.5-sack performance as a rookie in 2006. Beginning in October, Williams expressed frustration to reporters about his role in Ryan's scheme, which sometimes had him dropping into coverage instead of rushing the quarterback.\n\nWilliams told Anderson that he would like to meet halfway with coaches on the issue.\n\n\"We didn't have -- at least I feel like for myself -- we didn't have common ground as far as give-and-take on the scheme,\" he said. \"I have no problem listening, but like I said, at least have us doing half of the snaps of what we do best, and that's us going [on attack] and the guys in the [secondary] can cover.\n\n\"Last year I feel like we were way more blitz-happy than anything. I'm just saying we can meet halfway, so the guys who get after the quarterback can get more opportunities to do that, and set up your fill with the players inside you and make it happen like that. That's all I ask. I'm not saying throw the scheme out. That's what I was saying before. I never said anything was wrong with the scheme.\"Bills coach Rex Ryan joins NFL Insiders and praises the character of DE Mario Williams, stating that he would like to have him back in Buffalo next season.

{"id": "sample_6_225", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " PlayStation 4.\n\nXbox One S offers a far more attractive enclosure, options for a bigger hard drive, a slightly redesigned controller and some video perks for owners of 4K TVs. It starts at $300, £250 or AU$400 for the 500GB version; $350, £300 or AU$500 for a 1TB model; and $400, £350 or AU$549 for 2TB.\n\nThat last model is available to buy as of today in the US (and includes the vertical stand that otherwise costs $20 when purchased separately in the US), while those with the smaller hard drives will be available later in August, bundled with games such as Madden 17 and Halo. (Additional bundles will follow later in the year -- including a pricier 2TB Gears of War 4 version in October -- and may vary by region.)\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nSounds like a slam dunk, right? Unfortunately, it's never that simple. The One S doesn't get an across-the-board \"buy it now\" recommendation for two reasons. First off, it doesn't deliver huge improvements for anyone who already owns an Xbox One. But more importantly, Microsoft has already promised that the next Xbox -- dubbed Project Scorpio -- will be arriving in late 2017 with with the seriously amped-up graphics and VR-ready hardware that audiences are clamoring for.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, the Xbox One S should be primarily viewed as a slimmed-down version of the Xbox One that introduces a mildly updated controller and provisions for 4K display. It's not going to warp you into a state-of-the-art gaming experience. Pragmatically, you're probably better off nabbing an older Xbox One, which are now being sold at fire-sale prices. But if you are getting an Xbox One for the first time, have an interest in the bundled games and aren't saving your pennies for 2017's Project Scorpio, the One S is certainly a good all-round gaming and entertainment deal.\n\nWhat's new in the Xbox One S\n\nThere's a short but significant list of improvements and changes to the Xbox One S.\n\nSmaller, cleaner design: To start, it's 40 percent smaller, which considering its power supply is now internal, is impressive. It's also stark white, with some slick plastic moldings flanking the entirety of the box. I think it's the best-looking Xbox Microsoft has ever designed.\n\nThe One S can also stand vertically, too. The 2TB model we received for review packs in a stand. If you buy one of the other models, you can get the stand separately for $20.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\n4K and HDR video: Xbox One S gets a fairly beefy upgrade on its video capabilities, with 4K resolution (3,840x2,160, or four times as sharp as standard 1080p HDTVs) and HDR (high dynamic range, which is basically enhanced contrast and color). Keep in mind: those features only work on compatible TVs and 4K functionality only works with a small but growing list of compatible video content. 4K can currently be accessed through streaming video services such as Amazon and Netflix (as long as you have the bandwidth to support it and pay for their premium tier) and those new 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. Certain games, meanwhile, will eventually be able to take advantage of HDR visual improvements, but don't look for PC-like 4K graphics -- the games are merely upscaled to 4K.\n\nSo no, you're not getting native 4K gaming out of an Xbox One S. In fact, only a limited number of games will feature HDR and none of them are out yet. They are Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3 and 2017's Scalebound.\n\nNew controller design: The Xbox One controller has been updated for the S, too. It has a more streamlined top section, better range and textured grips. It can also use Bluetooth to connect, which opens the door for compatibility with other devices -- no more annoying dongles, at least on Bluetooth-compatible PCs.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not a fan of the new controller's design. It's not a drastic departure from the original, but there's just enough of a change to make it feel cheaper. The plastic textured grips don't feel good the way rubberized ones do, but thankfully the triggers seem unchanged. The D-pad also feels slightly less tactile -- I even noticed differences between two of the new controllers side by side.\n\nIR blaster and receiver: Still present is the IR port for controlling the console with a remote, but the Xbox One S also features an integrated IR blaster to control or power on other devices in the room.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nAnd it still does everything the old Xbox One does: The good", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

He and another panhandler brought a suit that alleges they lost up to $10 a day because authorities bar them from begging in Daley Plaza, a popular public square in the city. The trial that started today is a rare instance of jurors being asked to decide the issue of panhandlers' rights. (AP Photo/Michael Tarm)\n\nCHICAGO -- A federal civil trial pitting two panhandlers against one of the nation's largest sheriff's departments got underway Monday, in a case stemming from a lawsuit that alleges the men were improperly stopped from begging at a popular Chicago square.\n\nKim Pindak and Sam Phillips claim they lost up to $10 a day over four years because Cook County sheriff's deputies told them repeatedly they couldn't ask for money at Daley Plaza, best known for its iconic Chicago sculpture by Pablo Picasso.\n\nPindak, 63, said during a break in the trial that he was forced to supplement his income by begging because all but $30 of his $750-a-month federal disability assistance went toward paying living expenses at an assisted-living facility.\n\n\"A lot of people see us as scam artists,\" he said. \"I don't live in the Waldorf Astoria. I'm just trying to survive.\"\n\nWearing a sports jacket his attorneys bought him for the trial, Pindak said over lunch that he never imagined he would one day be a subject in a rare panhandler case to go before a federal jury. He quickly added, \"I never thought I would be a panhandler, either.\"\n\nHe said he once aspired to become a physician before suffering debilitating mental illness. The extra income from panhandling allows him to buy an occasional coffee, a pair of shoes or sometimes books about his favorite hobby -- chess.\n\nBack in the courtroom, he often looked uneasy as he sat at a table for the plaintiffs. The judge, Rebecca Pallmeyer, has presided over some of the most notable cases in recent Illinois history, including the corruption trial of former Illinois Gov. George Ryan.\n\nIn recent years, courts nationwide have increasingly agreed that asking passers-by for money is constitutionally protected free speech under the First Amendment, said Rebecca Glenberg, a civil liberties lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.\n\nA man panhandles on the street Monday, Jan. 25, 2016, in Chicago.

Spencer Green)\n\nThe case in Chicago will examine whether lax or nonexistent training for sheriff's deputies regarding panhandlers' rights contributed to violations of Pindak's and Phillips' rights.\n\nPallmeyer already ruled that the men's rights were violated, at least in some instances. Jurors will be asked to come up with a dollar amount for any damages determined.\n\nPindak calculates he may have lost up to $10 a day for four days a week over a four-year period because of the sheriff's department; that could add up to more than $8,000.\n\nAdele Nicholas, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told jurors during her opening statement Monday that the case is about the responsibility law enforcement agencies have to adequately train their staffs about citizens' rights. She said money wasn't the point.\n\n\"This case is about something bigger,\" she said. \"It's about responsible police practices.\"\n\nBut an attorney defending the sheriff's office, Patrick Russell, told jurors there was never a concerted effort to bar panhandlers from Daley Plaza. At worst, he said, panhandlers like Pindak might have been asked to \"move along\" from time to time.\n\nHe said they were not arrested, detained or prosecuted.\n\n\"So I ask you: What are the damages?\" he said.\n\nAnother attorney for the plaintiffs, Mark Weinberg, has filed other panhandler lawsuits. One, a 2001 class-action suit, argued it was illegal for Chicago to define panhandling as disorderly conduct.

It has been left divided roughly in two, with President Bashar al-Assad's forces controlling the west and rebels the east.\n\nAt the start of September, troops and Iranian-backed militiamen severed the rebels' last route into the east and placed its 275,000 residents under siege.\n\nTwo weeks later, following the collapse of a nationwide truce brokered by the US and Russia, the government launched a ground offensive to take full control of the city, accompanied by an aerial bombardment of unprecedented scale and intensity.\n\nAt an emergency session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Friday, Mr Zeid warned that \"crimes of historic proportions\" were being committed in eastern Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria.\n\n\"The ancient city of Aleppo, a place of millennial civility and beauty, is today a slaughterhouse - a gruesome locus of pain and fear, where the lifeless bodies of small children are trapped under streets of rubble and pregnant women deliberately bombed,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Zeid Raad Al Hussein said the failure to protect civilians in Syria \"should haunt everyone of us\"\n\nMr Zeid added that his staff had \"documented violations of international humanitarian law by all parties in Aleppo\".\n\n\"Armed opposition groups continue to fire mortars and other projectiles into civilian neighbourhoods of western Aleppo, but indiscriminate air strikes across the eastern part of the city by government forces and their allies are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties.\n\n\"These violations constitute war crimes.

Now, Salk Institute researchers have imaged how vital receptors on the surface of T cells bundle together when activated.\n\nThis study, the first to visualize this process in lymph nodes, could help scientists better understand how to turn up or down the immune system’s activity to treat autoimmune diseases, infections or even cancer. The results were published the week of June 13, 2016 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“We had seen these receptors cluster and reposition in cultured cells that were artificially stimulated in the lab, but we’ve never seen their natural arrangements in lymph nodes until now,” says senior author Björn Lillemeier, an associate professor in Salk’s Nomis Laboratories for Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis, and the Waitt Advanced Biophotonics Center.\n\nT cells are activated when receptors embedded in their outer membrane bind to other immune cells that have digested an antigen, such as a virus, bacteria or cancer cell. In turn, the activated T cells switch on cellular pathways that help the body both actively seek out and destroy the antigen and remember it for the future. In the past, by looking at T-cell receptors embedded in isolated cells under the microscope, researchers discovered that the receptors are arranged in clusters—called protein islands—that merge when the cells are activated.\n\nLillemeier wanted more detail on how the receptors are arranged in tissue and how that arrangement might change when the T cells are activated in living hosts. The team used a super-resolution microscope developed in the laboratory of co-senior author Hu Cang, assistant professor at Salk’s Waitt Advanced Biophotonics Center and holder of the Frederick B. Rentschler Developmental Chair. This microscopy approach, called light-sheet direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), let the researchers watch T cell receptors in the membranes of T cells in mouse lymph nodes at a resolution of approximately 50 nanometers.\n\nThe new imagery confirmed the previous observation that protein islands of T-cell receptors merge into larger “microclusters” when T cells are activated. But it also showed that, before cells are activated, the protein islands are already arranged in groups—dubbed “territories” by Lillemeier’s team. “The pre-organization on the molecular level basically turns the T cell into a loaded gun,” says Lillemeier.\n\nThe organization of surface receptors enables T cells to launch fast and effective immune response against antigens. Understanding how the molecular organization mediates the sensitivity of T cell responses could help researchers make the immune system more or less sensitive. In the case of autoimmune diseases, clinicians would like to turn down the immune system’s activity, while turning up the activity could help fight infections or cancers.\n\nThe research could also have implications for understanding other receptors in the body, which have a wide range of functions both within and outside the immune system. “We think that most receptors on the surfaces of cells are organized like this,” says Ying Hu, first author and postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute.\n\nThe work and the researchers involved were supported by grants from the NOMIS Foundation, the Waitt Foundation, the James B. Pendleton Charitable Trust, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke, the National Cancer Institute and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.June 15, 2016\n\nSuper-resolution microscopy reveals unprecedented detail of immune cells’ surface\n\nSalk scientists show how T-cell receptors reposition during an immune response, revealing more on how the immune system is regulated\n\nJune 15, 2016\n\nLA JOLLA—When the body is fighting an invading pathogen, white blood cells—including T cells—must respond.

{"id": "sample_6_244", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " when it comes time to cast their ballots.\n\nThe patronizing nicknames and language contained in the nearly 20,000 emails from January 2015 through May 2016 that were released through WikiLeaks last week implicated several DNC staffers in showing disdain for heartland voters. This bias severely discredited the DNC, which is supposed to remain neutral concerning Democratic candidates during the presidential primaries. But as the emails show, several officials heavily favored former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders while showing contempt for constituents.\n\n“This could make several points difference with my peeps. My southern baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It might may [sic] no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief,” Brad Marshall, chief financial officer of the DNC, wrote in an email dated May 5, 2016, that was titled “no sh*t.” The email apparently refers to Sanders, who is Jewish. “Does he believe in God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My southern baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.”\n\nClinton did not performed well in America’s heartland during the Democratic primaries, mainly because her agenda is much more liberal than voters there. She has insulted southerners throughout her campaign, and once promised “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,” which prompted protests in West Virginia when she campaigned there.\n\nIn a twist, rather than denying the he wrote it and blaming others — as Clinton always does — Marshall said he regretted his words. In a Facebook post, he wrote: “I deeply regret that my insensitive, emotional emails would cause embarrassment to the DNC, the Chairwoman, and all of the staffers who worked hard to make the primary a fair and open process. The comments expressed do not reflect my beliefs nor do they reflect the beliefs of the DNC and its employees. I apologize to those I offended.”\n\nSanders on Sunday was appalled by the revelations, and his campaign called for “someone to be held accountable.”\n\n“I am not an atheist,” Sanders to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “But aside from all of that, it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying, the function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates – to be fair and even-minded.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[lz_third_party includes=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDpdOifwVJE”]\n\nIn response, Sanders condemned the sentiments revealed in the emails and called for DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign. Wasserman Schultz has been removed from her duties at the DNC in Philadelphia this week, and by mid-afternoon Sunday, she announced that she would step down from her position after the convention.\n\n“I don’t think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC not only for these awful emails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people, and I don’t think her leadership style is doing that,” Sanders told Tapper.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump also expressed his outrage and frustration with the DNC over the leaks.\n\n[lz_third_party includes=”https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/756804886038192128″]\n\n“Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED,” Trump tweeted on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, responded to the emails leak by attempting to shift the blame to Russian hackers, who he claimed are in cahoots with Trump. Mook claimed that the leak corresponds with the GOP’s inclusion of “changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-Russian.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think that’s disturbing,” Mook said on “State of the Union.” “I think when you put all this together, it’s a disturbing picture, and voters need to reflect on that.”\n\n[lz_related_box id=”175484″]\n\nTrump�", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_248", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " woman who said the officer asked for help finding a gang member to kill the administrator, Lake County Major Task Force member Christopher Covelli said.\n\nWhen authorities talked to the gang member, he denied having a conversation with Gliniewicz about a hit, Covelli said. No other evidence was found about a hit.\n\nAt a press conference, Fox Lake Village Administrator Anne Marrin was asked how it felt to know a police officer apparently wanted her dead.\n\n\"Unsettling,\" she said of the inquiry. \"It's quite unbelievable and almost surreal.\"\n\nMarrin said she was asking questions about the youth group that police say Gliniewicz was stealing from. She said she didn't know about Gliniewicz' plans until after his death and doesn't feel in danger now.\n\n\"Even though these threats were made months ago, I take these threats very seriously,\" she said.\n\nThe hit man revelation is the latest turn in a story that has shaken Fox Lake, a community northwest of Chicago.\n\nGliniewicz, a veteran officer with 30 years experience, was found shot to death on September 1 after he radioed that he was chasing suspects into a wooded area while on patrol. No arrests were made. The community mourned the shaved-head military veteran known as G.I. Joe.\n\nAuthorities didn't truly suspect Gliniewicz had killed himself until about two weeks ago, when bank statements and text messages revealed the extent of his stealing, said George Filenko, Lake County Major Crimes Task Force commander.\n\nMoney taken from Explorers Post\n\nGliniewicz stole \"tens of thousands\" of dollars from the Explorers Post, an organization for youths interested in law enforcement careers, Marrin said. The police department sponsored the group and Gliniewicz was the leader. Investigators said he used the money to pay his mortgage and other expenses.\n\nMarrin said her relations with Gliniewicz were always cordial.\n\n\"We never fought,\" she said. \"There were no harsh words.\"\n\nBut he was reluctant to provide information about the Explorers. She asked for but didn't receive schedules of activities, a list of members or parental consent forms, she said.\n\n\"They didn't have a budget,\" Marrin said. \"That was part of the problem.\"\n\nA day or two before Gliniewicz' death, she asked for an inventory of equipment owned by the Explorers, she said. He didn't provide it by the deadline and she asked again.\n\n\"His email said, 'I will have that information for you by noon or 1 o'clock at the latest,' \" she said.\n\nThat was on September 1. Gliniewicz was found dead later that day.\n\nThe lieutenant sent word over his radio at 7:52 a.m. that he was pursuing a trio on foot. Three minutes later, he requested backup. Radio communication dropped off. Colleagues would not hear Gliniewicz's voice again.\n\nThe backups arrived about 8 a.m. and a few minutes later found Gliniewicz dead. His body was roughly 50 yards from his cruiser, police said. The officer's .40-caliber pistol was found at the scene.\n\nA massive manhunt followed, with 400 law enforcement officers looking through the woods around the crime scene and helicopters hovered overhead.\n\nGliniewicz was wearing a bulletproof vest at the time he was shot, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. One of the officials said two shots hit Gliniewicz -- one stopped by his bulletproof vest, and another entered his torso at a downward angle.\n\nRecovered text messages\n\nGliniewicz had deleted 6,500 text messages, Filke said. Investigators spent weeks recovering them.\n\nIn one messages that police released, Gliniewicz talked about how much he disliked Marrin.\n\n\"We have a new village administrator that is a power monger and is trying to control everything in the village,\" Gliniewicz said, adding that many officers were considering retirement.\n\nThe officer allegedly had discussed causing harm to Marrin.\n\n\"Hopefully she decides to get a couple of drinks in her and she gets a dui,\" said a person identified as \"Individual #2.\"\n\nGliniewicz replied, \"She does, but not around here and no one knows where. Trust me ive thought through MANY SCENARIOS from planting things to the volo bog!\" Apparently he meant the Volo Bog, a state park with a lake near Fox Lake.\n\nAfter Gliniewicz' death, investigators found packets of cocaine in his desk. Authorities haven't said whether those were the \"things\" he considered planting in her car. The evidence bag with cocaine was not marked and it did not have a case number on it, investigators said. The toxicology report did not include a positive finding for cocaine.\n\n", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1023}}

It is unclear when the attack took place, but the images began appearing online on August 27. Hundreds of refugees have shared the images of the attack on dozens of private Arabic-speaking refugee Facebook groups, Vocativ discovered.\n\nThe images, showing body parts with bloody, and sometimes deep, wounds, have caused hundreds of mostly Syrian refugees to warn one another against using Hungary’s border with Serbia to travel deeper into Europe.

They tried to cross from Serbia to Hungary but they were beaten, attacked by police dogs sent at them and now the wounded are in Belgrade (Serbia) receiving medical treatment.”\n\nThe user also complained of the “media’s silence” in response to the incident, and added: “Stay away from Hungary, brothers. The road is closed, don’t torture yourself.”\n\nAnother asked: “How much more do we have to warn you of the smugglers ‘promises’…” They claimed: “This incident led to bad injuries of some migrants, seven of which were women and children.

This is the meaning of the pasuk, “You shall not wear combined fibers, wool and linen together.”\n\nThe term “Shatnez” is actually an acronym for the different aspects involved in processing cloths.\n\nREASON\n\nIt is a Chok – which means a law in the Torah that we observe. This is the ratzon Hashem, and we do it. The Midrash Rabbah on Bereishis explains, however, that Kayin brought Hashem an offering of flax, while Hevel brought an offering of sheep. Kayin killed Hevel and we therefore observe Shatnez as a reminder of this horrible event – never to mix the two korbanos.\n\nINTERESTING ASPECTS\n\nShatnez is forbidden miDeoraisah – by the Torah when it is worn as a normal garment.\n\nShatnez not worn but stepped upon is assur miderabanan (eg carpets, car upholstery). It is forbidden when there is the concern that the shatnez may come off and cling to the person’s body. The hats, if they contain the Shatnez, would be an issur d’oraisah.\n\nAlthough one should check with his own Rav or Posaik, the prevalence of Shatnez in this case may be such that one should refrain from wearing the pompom wool hats until they are checked. Some may have linen threads attaching the pompom to the hat, others may not.\n\nIt should also be noted that Shaatnez has been found in the furry Russian hats worn by men.\n\nThe author may be reached at yairhoffman2@gmail.com[By Rabbi Yair Hoffman for the Five Towns Jewish Times]\n\nOf late, one of the more popular hat styles is to wear a wool hat with a pompom on it (for women, not men).

{"id": "sample_6_263", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "ABOUT THE STORY Arif Ayaz Parrey’s achievement in this story is the evocation of an entire climate of fear and suspicion in Kashmir without the use of any characters or events. The story works purely as a text about another text—a torture manual allegedly used in the repression of the insurgency—and through its ironic repetition of the language and categories, at once bureaucratic and sinister, of the manual. The only person whom we know by the name in the story—the “Major Ali” of the title—appears to be fictional twice over. Even his reality as a character in fiction is disturbed by the notion that he may have first been invented by the nameless, shadowy powers whose motives and modus operandi the story describes.\n\nParrey drops us into a maze of smoke and mirrors, disorienting us in a manner analogous to the “sustainable and ever-widening cycle of distrust” that the torture manual seeks to generate among “the subject population”. It’s not even clear where the narrator himself stands, or which of the manual’s five classes of Kashmiris on the resistor/collaborator axis he inhabits, or—most disturbingly—whether he may himself be “Major Ali” in a new guise, now a wolf in sheep’s clothing. In this way, Parrey renovates the narrative tactic of self-reflexivity—a playful gesture in the work of Laurence Sterne or Beckett or Borges, but here, the default setting of all human activity when subjected to the modern state’s mania for control and power.\n\nThe Torture Manual of Major AliABOUT THE STORY Arif Ayaz Parrey’s achievement in this story is the evocation of an entire climate of fear and suspicion in Kashmir without the use of any characters or events.

He is being held in the St. Louis County Jail on $20,000 bail.\n\nConfrontation: Bryan James Hathaway, right, has been charged with assaulting off-duty police officer Kody Vedder, left, when she tried to detain him after spotting the 25-year-old acting suspiciously\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Vedder was off duty and shopping at Walmart with her 11-year-old daughter after getting off work Monday evening, Duluth News Tribune reported.\n\nThe officer was wearing a black T-shirt with the word POLICE emblazoned across the front and back of the shirt in bold white letters.\n\nWith her shopping done, Vedder was walking back to her car when she spotted Hathaway in the backseat of a Lincoln Town Car parked next to her.\n\nThe complaint states that the officer thought that the man appeared suspicious by the way he was repeatedly ducking down and watching out for passersby.\n\nVedder got out of her car, knocked on the window of the vehicle where Hathaway was sitting and pointed to the lettering on her shirt. She then told the 25-year-old that she is a cop and instructed him not to move.\n\nCrime scene: The incident happened in the parking lot of the Hermantown Walmart in Wisconsin\n\nThe officer called 911 and asked for police response, but before the reinforcement had a chance to arrive, Hathaway tried to make a run for it, according to the complaint.\n\nVedder grabbed the suspect by the back of his shirt and attempted to drag him down to the ground, but the complaint states that Hathaway wrenched himself out of her grasp and pushed her to the pavement.\n\nVedder suffered scratches and bruises to her tail bone in the confrontation that required an X-ray.\n\nBy that point, officers from three nearby police departments arrived on the scene and apprehended Hathaway near a Volkswagen dealership.\n\nWhen police searched the car where Vedder first spotted Hathaway, they recovered a backpack containing two Android cell phones in boxes, one of which still had the security device from Walmart around it.\n\nBizarre case: In 2006, Hathaway, then 18, was convicted of having sex with the carcass of a deer he found in a ditch while biking\n\nOfficers also seized a Virgin Mobile LG cell phone and a new power cord in a plastic bag from the same store.\n\nThis incident comes less than six years after Hathaway was arrested for having sex with a dead deer.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, then-18-year-old Hathaway stumbled upon the animal’s carcass while biking along Stinson Avenue, Chicago Sun-Time reported.\n\nRepeat offender: In 2005, Hathaway pleaded no contest to shooting an Arabian horse for the purpose of having sex with the animal\n\nHathaway told detectives that he was aroused by the sight of the deer in the ditch. He admitted moving the carcass into the woods and assaulting it.\n\n‘When I was done, I was upset with myself,’ Hathaway said in a statement to police at the time. ‘I know having sex with animals is wrong. But I can't help myself and I need help.’\n\nHe pleaded no contest to a charge of sexual gratification with an animal and was ordered to undergo psychological treatment after receiving a probationary sentence.\n\nIn April of 2005, Hathaway pleaded no contest to a felony animal mistreatment charge in connection with the shooting of an Arabian horse in Douglas County.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint in that case, Hathaway told investigators that he gunned down the animal, a 26-year-old gelding named Bambrick, for the purpose of having sex with it.\n\nHowever, Hathaway never got a chance to carry", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

The couple was raided again.\n\n“We fired anyone who wasn’t following the code of the law,” Schafer said.\n\n“We weren’t selling the medical cannabis to my patients,” Dr. Fry said. “We had staff and were charging $10 for delivery only, and that’s a common practice today.”\n\nThen the absurdity of their trial kicked in.\n\n“The judge wouldn’t allow any medical evidence. They wouldn’t let us tell the jury I was sick, or that I was a doctor,” Fry said. “They wouldn’t allow that I was helping sick patients.\n\n“Ironically, two years before the raid, local authorities asked me to tell them who of my patients were ‘really’ sick, and who wasn’t. I told them it wasn’t my job to police my patients, and when I was in the thick of helping people, I knew it was the right thing to do,” she said. “Cannabis helped me immensely when I was going through cancer.”\n\n​Dr. Fry is a product of seven generations of doctors in her family tree. Her grandfather, Dr. Francis Marion Pottenger, played a part in curing tuberculosis in the early 1900s and her grandmother studied under Carl Jung in the 1950s. Her mother was also a physician.\n\n“Cannabis is proven medicine,” Fry said. “Why would the state of California create laws based on what the people want, and then allow the federal government to override them? I had cancer; we were growing medicine. I was helping people.”\n\nOn Thursday in California, Governor Jerry Brown, in an effort to stop the state from financially bleeding to death, slashed somewhere between seven and TEN BILLION dollars. He still needs to find another $14 billion so California doesn’t have to send their kids to Arizona for an education.\n\nLast year, around 6,500 prisoners were released due to overcrowding and not having the bucks for our rising correctional costs. Not to get too sensationalized in print, that creep, Phillip Garrido, who had kidnapped a young lady and was discovered in 2009 that he kept her hidden in his backyard for 18 years? That guy was let go under a similar release program. But police didn’t follow his activities or scrutinize his movements, because he apparently wasn’t a dangerous lawbreaker like Dr. Fry and Mr. Schafer.\n\nThe United States has the highest documented rate of incarceration in the world.\n\n​A governor doesn’t need the permission of the state’s governing boards to let out prisoners. He already has that power; it’s called a pardon. Like in the old time movies where the tension built as the warden waited for a call from the governor to commute Humphrey Bogart’s sentence.\n\nJerry Brown could pardon this couple tomorrow if he wished. Our governor has made it clear that he is not jumping on the cannabis movement in any form or shape. That wouldn’t be prudent. Howard Zinn says, “You can’t be neutral on a moving train.”\n\nThis isn’t an issue of medical marijuana or state budgets; it is a matter of common sense. Dr. Fry and Mr. Schafer are not criminals, but are now defined as such by the State of California. We have spent millions prosecuting a couple, that if they lived 50 miles to their west, might not have the complications they are experiencing in the state’s capitol city.\n\nNo one’s ever going to hand you your freedoms; sometimes, you just have to take it.\n\nCall the governor, your state person, the people in Sacramento, wherever your voice or dollars can make a change.\n\nDr. Fry’s license to practice has been revoked for some time now, as has her husband’s license to practice law. The couple’s grown children with grandkids have moved back home to help with finances and save the family home. A PayPal account has been set up for donations.\n\nCool Madness, a book written about the trial by author Vanessa Williams, is available online through , a book written about the trial by author Vanessa Williams, is available online through Amazon.com or other online booksellers.\n\nDonations and correspondence of support can also be sent to the family at PO Box 634, Cool, CA 95614.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown can be reached at (916", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_279", "config_id": 6, "prompt": ".[3]\n\nIn 1918, faced with complaints from farmers that the Food Administration created under the Act had set the minimum price of wheat too low, Congress passed an amendment increasing that level from $2.20 to $2.40 per bushel. The President's veto out of concerns about inflation and the impact on the British, is credited with producing disastrous results for Democrats in the 1918 elections in the states of the grain belt.[4]\n\nOn August 18, 1919, after the end of hostilities, President Wilson asked Congress to extend the life of the Act to allow his administration to address widespread and dramatic increases in the prices of commodities. He requested amendments to include clothing and to set increased penalties for profiteering. Opponents delayed passage for months while berating the administration for its failure to control prices and then granted the authority the President requested in October. In the House of Representatives, the President's chief critic complained of the administration's priorities: \"Where there is one man in a thousand who cares a rap about the League of Nations, there are nine hundred and ninety-nine who are vitally and distressingly concerned about the high cost of living.\" The Department of Justice launched 179 prosecutions under the amended Act in the first two months following its passage.[5]\n\nImplementation [ edit ]\n\n\"Food will win the war\"\n\nUnited States Food Administration poster\n\nThe Act, an emergency wartime measure, was designed to expire at the end of World War I or shortly thereafter. It created two agencies, the Food Administration and the Fuel Administration.\n\nTo head the Food Administration, the President named Herbert Hoover who had handled Belgian relief at the beginning of the war and had coordinating food and fuel supplies since May 1917 on Wilson's personal authority.[2] As United States Food Administrator he had the authority to fix food prices, license distributors, coordinate purchases, oversee exports, act against hoarding and profiteering, and encourage farmers to grow more crops. He emphasized the needs of America's allies, both those under arms and the civilian populations, for American produce. He encouraged American households to consume less meat and bread.\n\nWilson issued a proclamation in January 1918 calling upon Americans to demonstrate their patriotism by following Hoover's guidelines. There were voluntary \"meatless Tuesdays\" and \"sweetless Saturdays.\" Tuesdays and Saturdays were \"porkless.\" Both Mondays and Wednesday would be \"wheatless.\" Compliance was voluntary, though the baking industry, including hotels and restaurants, was limited to the production of war bread and rolls called \"victory bread.\" Initially it was made from at least 5% of grains other than wheat and that amount increased to 20% by February 24. His agency asked households to pledge their support and some 13 million of 18 million did so. Hoover's call for the conservation of the nation's produce emphasized voluntary compliance:[6]\n\nThe effectiveness of these rules is dependent solely upon the goodwill of, and the willingness to sacrifice by, the American people. In the last analysis, the success or failure of any plan such as that here outlined rests with the people. We are dependent upon the cooperation of the trades. We have but one police force – the American woman – and we depend upon her to organize in co-operation with our State and local Food Administrators to see that these rules are obeyed by that small minority who may fail. Part of the rules will be enforced under the Lever Food act; other parts are voluntary, and will depend for their success upon public sentiment. Our experience hitherto has shown a willingness of the vast majority of consumers, and a full co-operation of the trades, to undergo the self-sacrifice necessary to render such measures effective. The small minority who refuse to cooperate should not be allowed to defeat the nation's necessities.\n\nChildren were organized into the \"United States School Garden Army.\" When eating apples, Boy Scouts were urged to be \"patriotic to the core.\" Citizens were encouraged to grow \"victory gardens\" of vegetables in their backyards and vacant lots. Slogans like \"By all means, save the beans\" became popular. The Food Administration also fixed the price of a bushel of wheat, the price floor being $2 a bushel and the ceiling at $2.20. One of its posters said: \"FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR; DON’T WASTE IT.\" By the end of 1918, about one-fourth of all American production was diverted to the war effort.\n\nJanuary 1918 editorial cartoon by Oscar Cesare showing the U.S. Capitol boarded up and signs reading, \"Closed; no fuel; all business conducted at White House.\"\n\nThe Fuel Administration under Harry Garfield, the President of Williams College, directed efforts to save coal.

The White House said later North Korea would need to meet many conditions before it could be contemplated.\"Clearly conditions are not there right now,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.\"I don't see this happening anytime soon.\"Trump warned in an interview with Reuters on Thursday that a \"major, major conflict\" with North Korea was possible, while China said last week the situation on the Korean peninsula could escalate or slip out of control.In a show of force, the United States has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group, led by the USS Carl Vinson, to waters off the Korean peninsula to conduct drills with South Korea and Japan.The U.S. military's THAAD anti-missile defence system has reached initial operational capacity in South Korea, U.S. officials told Reuters, although they cautioned that it would not be fully operational for some months.North Korea test-launched a missile on Saturday that appeared to have failed within minutes, its fourth successive failed launch since March. It has conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile-related activities at an unprecedented pace since the beginning of last year.The North is technically still at war with the South after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, and regularly threatens to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea.Donald Trump said he was open to meeting Kim Jong-un in the appropriate circumstances\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2017\n\nNorth Korea accused the United States on Tuesday of pushing the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war after a pair of strategic U.S. bombers flew training drills with the South Korean and Japanese air forces in another show of strength.The two", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_291", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " and moral standards. Drug trials were halted over the most tenuous rumor that a similar drug in development by a competitor was running into issues. Sales staff took pains to educate doctors about the downsides of Merck’s treatments.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Merck really was a company where shareholder value was the result, not a prime motivation.\n\nIt ran huge, productive research labs full of top-notch scientists. In charge of those labs was Roy Vagelos, who went from chief scientist to become CEO in 1984.\n\nDan Bobkoff / Business Insider\n\n“My interest was never making money,” Vagelos, 86, said in an interview with Business Insider and Marketplace. “Even as CEO. Especially as CEO.”\n\nBy today’s standards of management, it’s as if Vagelos did everything wrong.\n\n'We’re leaving money on the table'\n\nHe refused to raise drug prices more than inflation. When he told that to Merck’s marketing team, Vagelos said, “They said, 'We’re leaving money on the table,' of course. And I said, 'Fine, that’s what we’ll do.'”\n\nHe bailed out of business school after just a week, which is maybe why he didn’t think much about Wall Street.\n\n“I never worried about stockholders ever. It never crossed my mind. I even refused to meet with stock analysts.”\n\nAt one point, he made a last-minute decision to donate a massive quantity of a drug that cured river blindness in patients in Africa. It cost the company a lot of money.\n\n“One of the people — when I was reporting it — at the next board meeting said, ‘You never called us!’ And I said it was going so fast, it never crossed my mind. I forgot about it.”\n\nYou could be cynical about this. You could argue holding down drug prices helped stave off regulations, and there were a lot of public relations benefits to that donation in Africa.\n\nBut by not focusing on maximizing shareholder value, Merck did really well. During Vagelos' era, it came out with lots of new drugs, which led Merck’s stock price to increase an average of 22 percent per year. In the years since, it has been just 5 percent a year.\n\nBut these days, it’s just about impossible to run a company the way Vagelos ran Merck.\n\n“You have to provide a little bit of something for everybody,” said Brent Saunders, the CEO of Allergan. You might know it as the maker of Botox. Allergan is highly respected by Wall Street and its competitors, but Saunders can’t ignore investors.\n\n“You need to have good short-term performance,\" he said in an interview with Business Insider and Marketplace. \"You have to have sound midterm strategy and performance, and ultimately, because of the product cycle and the way we innovate over the long term, really have conviction around your long-term strategy. I try to do it all.”\n\nHere are some of the ways Allergan is a model of a modern pharmaceutical company, with its research, price and tax strategies:\n\nAllergan more often acquires drugs or companies rather than go through the risky process of discovering and developing drugs from scratch, as companies like Merck did in their heyday.\n\nA good portion of its R&D pipeline is dedicated to finding new purposes for existing drugs like Botox, which currently has 11 approved uses and more on the way. So far it can be used for wrinkles, migraines, overactive bladders and more.\n\n'It’s like milking a cow'\n\n“Their success is really based on a drug that seems to be just like the market opportunities are endless,” said Oner Tulum, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “It’s like milking a cow.”\n\nSaunders calls Botox “a pipeline in a product.”\n\nAnd Saunders can’t ignore his share price, especially now that he has one of the most famous activist investors taking a big stake in Allergan: Carl Icahn.\n\n“I view Carl as just one of many important shareholders,” Saunders said. “We listen to all of our shareholders, activist and passive, and long term and short term.”\n\nIcahn is leaving Saunders alone for now, but that could change. He has a history of pressuring companies to make moves and then getting out of the stock.\n\nTo save on taxes, Allergan is technically an Irish company", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_295", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " the last decade. As testimony before a Joint Economic Committee suggests, there are a variety of reasons for this, although an aging population is clearly part of the issue.\n\nThe Lack of Middle Class Jobs\n\nGrowing inequality is another big issue—the hallmark of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, and an issue that is occasionally even mentioned by Republican candidates. An overall lack of jobs is less of a problem for our economy, however, than the shortage of well-paying, middle class jobs.\n\nMany of the new jobs in the US over the last decade or two have been low-end service jobs—feeding, selling to, and taking care of our fellow Americans. These jobs don’t generally produce a lot of revenue or grow much in productivity, so it’s difficult for businesses to pay high wages to workers who perform them. And that situation isn’t going to change much no matter who is president. As a New York Times article points out, our economy is a service economy, and it’s been going in that direction for several decades now.\n\nFree Trade Isn’t the Problem\n\nThere is little doubt that some of our well-paying manufacturing jobs have gone to places like Mexico and China. But recent trade deals aren’t the problem, capitalism is. For several centuries now, manufacturing has moved to places where it’s done most cheaply and effectively. And for most industries, that place hasn’t been the U.S. for a while.\n\nDonald Trump’s bluster notwithstanding, it seems highly unlikely that any president could change this much. As a society we don’t generally like to tell businesspeople where they can produce stuff, and we don’t like paying high tariffs for stuff made elsewhere. Corporate moves to low-tax countries do some damage to our tax base, but they don’t tend to involve many jobs.\n\nAutomation Is Good\n\nIronically, our best hope for bringing manufacturing jobs home is automation. Also ironically, the same is true for outsourced service jobs. Since the U.S. is one of the world’s leaders in automation technologies, we’ve got some chance of bringing jobs home if we have the best automation capabilities and the people who are best at working with automation technologies.\n\nIn factories, this means technologists who can install, maintain, and optimize robots, CAD/CAM, and flexible manufacturing cells. In services, it means working with tools like robotic process automation and cognitive technologies that can do work previously outsourced to low-wage countries. Whether in factories or offices, all those automation machines need people to configure, install, and tend them. Because most of the actual work is done by machines, there won’t be huge numbers of jobs that will come home this way, but there will be some.\n\nInformation Technology is a Drag\n\nInformation technology hasn’t eliminated a lot of jobs, but it is keeping some from growing. Take bank tellers, for example. Contrary to what President Obama said in a 2014 interview, automated teller machines haven’t led to many fewer jobs in that field. Mr. Obama may not run into them when he needs cash, but the number of bank tellers in the U.S. has remained pretty constant since 1980, when ATMs really took off. Of course, the U.S. has grown a lot in population since 1980, but the number of tellers hasn’t. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of tellers will decline about 8% over the next decade—not a precipitous decline, but certainly not a growth occupation either.\n\nThe Service Sector Slowdown\n\nIn the future, many lower-level service jobs are going to stop growing—if not decline—because of technology. There are already some pretty capable technologies that automate truck and taxi driving, hamburger ordering and preparation, lawn mowing, and so forth. They’ll get better and cheaper over time. Human workers will get more expensive. If I were in one of these fields, I’d learn how to sell, install, or fix these machines.\n\nProfessionals Should Be Wary\n\nThe same is true for many professional jobs. There are already smart machines that can do some of the key tasks of lawyers, doctors, marketers, journalists, and even scientists. Not all of the incumbents of these knowledge work roles will lose their jobs, but some will. If you don’t want to be one of the losers, again, your best bet is to make sure you know how to work alongside these machines and add value to them.\n\nThe lessons from all this are pretty clear. If you’re voting for your preferred candidate because you believe they can reverse the economic trends of the last several decades, you might want to reconsider your choice or your reason for it. You may also want to think about whether you", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

But while the boys may still be clad in their AC/DC and Metallica shirts, they’ve got an whole lot of ammunition at their disposal when it comes to pop culture, including Jersey Shore and Twilight.\n\nWriter-creator Mike Judge and executive producer Van Toffler offered a glimpse Friday at the Television Critics’ Association summer press tour at what could be expected from the animated hit.\n\n1. Judge was nervous about including Jersey Shore in Beavis and Butt-head and watched MTV’s reality hit at Toffler’s recommendation. “It was paydirt,” Judge said, confessing that he’s now “hooked” on the Jersey crew. Toffler, meanwhile, doesn’t expect the housemates to ask for additional compensation when they appear in clips on the animated series. “I’d be scared to think of them with more money than they already have,” Toffler said, noting that he expects the gang to love being subjected to the Beavis and Butt-head treatment.\n\nSTORY: ‘Beavis and Butt-Head Returning to MTV’\n\n2. Time stands still. Judge said he wanted new episodes to be topical – Twilight and vampire humor is included in the new trailer – but that there won’t be a specific instance where the series acknowledges the nearly 15-year gap between new episodes. “I wanted to make it not feel too forced; to make it as seamless as I could to what it was how ever many years ago,” he noted.\n\n3. There’s plenty of ammunition for the boys to riff on. Judge said targets in the new episodes include UFC fights, Internet stuff and ... movie reviews. “We have a think where they’re kind of like Siskel & Ebert,” he said.\n\n4. The animation process has been updated. When the original series aired from 1993 to 1997, Judge noted that Beavis and Butt-head — like The Simpsons and King of the Hill – was hand inked and painted onto cells and shot on film. That’s all been digitized now. “It still looks crappy,” Judge joked. “But I like the way it looks.” “It’s high-def, there are some differences.”\n\nSTORY: ‘Beavis and Butt-Head’ Riff on ‘Jersey Shore’ in MTV Series Relaunch (Video)\n\n5. The boys will still be watching music videos. MGMT, Deadmau5 and Tbaby’s “It’s So Cold in the D” will be among the artists Judge noted will be getting the Beavis & Butt-head treatment.\n\n6. Beavis, meet technology. With Beavis and Butt-head returning to a world that now features cell phones, Facebook and Twitter, Judge said he didn’t want to force “all the modern stuff on them,” but did tease to an upcoming episode where the boys work in tech support.\n\n7. Daria might be back. MTV’s Toffler, an executive producer on the series, notes that the animated spinoff from Beavis and Butt-head that airs in reruns on MTV2 and Logo and has done well on both. “We’ve talked to the creators so there is not as long a shot as you’d think that Daria might be back on one of our channels.\n\nBeavis and Butt-head premieres the first of its 12 new episodes on Oct. 27 at 10 p.m. on MTV.\n\nEmail: Lesley.Goldberg@thr.com; Twitter: @SnooditNot much will have changed when Beavis and Butt-head returns to MTV in the fall after nearly 15 years off the air.

{"id": "sample_6_317", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " White House report on the alleged chemical weapons attack in Idlib. He notes:\n\n'The only source the document cites as evidence that the attack was by the Syrian government [air force] is the crater it claims to have identified on a road in the North of Khan Shaykhun.'\n\nBut Postol claims that the White House's photographic evidence 'clearly indicates that the munition was almost certainly placed on the ground with an external detonating explosive on top of it that crushed the container so as to disperse the alleged load of sarin'.\n\nHe adds:\n\n'I have reviewed the document carefully, and I believe it can be shown, without doubt, that the document does not provide any evidence whatsoever that the US government has concrete knowledge that the government of Syria was the source of the chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun, Syria at roughly 6 to 7 a.m. on April 4, 2017. 'No competent analyst would assume that the crater cited as the source of the sarin attack was unambiguously an indication that the munition came from an aircraft. No competent analyst would assume that the photograph of the carcass of the sarin canister was in fact a sarin canister. Any competent analyst would have had questions about whether the debris in the crater was staged or real. No competent analyst would miss the fact that the alleged sarin canister was forcefully crushed from above, rather than exploded by a munition within it. All of these highly amateurish mistakes indicate that this White House report... was not properly vetted by the intelligence community as claimed.'\n\nPostol's conclusion could hardly be more damning:\n\n'I have worked with the intelligence community in the past, and I have grave concerns about the politicization of intelligence that seems to be occurring with more frequency in recent times – but I know that the intelligence community has highly capable analysts in it. And if those analysts were properly consulted about the claims in the White House document they would have not approved the document going forward.' 'We again have a situation where the White House has issued an obviously false, misleading and amateurish intelligence report.'\n\nPostol recently told The Nation:\n\n'What I think is now crystal clear is that the White House report was fabricated and it certainly did not follow the procedures it claimed to employ.'\n\nHe added:\n\n'My best guess at the moment is that this was an extremely clumsy and ill-conceived attempt to cover up the fact that Trump attacked Syria without any intelligence evidence that Syria was in fact the perpetrator of the attack.... It may be that the White House staff was worried that this could eventually come out—a reckless president acting without regard to the nation's security, risking an inadvertent escalation and confrontation with Russia, and a breakdown in cooperation with Russia that would cripple our efforts to defeat the Islamic State. 'If that is not an impeachable offense, then I do not know what is.'\n\nRobert Parry, an investigative reporter who broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s, comments:\n\n'On April 11, five days after Trump's decision to attack the Syrian airbase, Trump's White House released a four-page \"intelligence assessment\" that offered another alleged motivation, Khan Sheikhoun's supposed value as a staging area for a rebel offensive threatening government infrastructure. But that offensive had already been beaten back and the town was far from the frontlines. 'In other words, there was no coherent motive for Assad to have dropped sarin on this remote town. There was, however, a very logical reason for Al Qaeda's jihadists to stage a chemical attack and thus bring pressure on Assad's government. (There's also the possibility of an accidental release via a conventional government bombing of a rebel warehouse or from the rebels mishandling a chemical weapon – although some of the photographic evidence points more toward a staged event.)'\n\nWe have no idea who was responsible for the mass killings in Idlib on April 4; we are not weapons experts. But it seems obvious to us that arguments and evidence offered by credible sources like Postol should at least be aired by the mass media. As Parry writes:\n\n'The role of an honest press corps should be to apply skepticism to all official stories, not carry water for \"our side\" and reject anything coming from the \"other side,\" which is what The New York Times, The Washington Post and the rest of the Western mainstream media have done, especially regarding Middle East policies and now the New Cold War with Russia.'\n\nOur search of the Lexis database (April 26) finds that no UK newspaper article has mentioned the words 'Postol' and 'Syria' in the last month. In our April 12 media alert, we noted that former and current UN weapons inspectors Hans Blix, Scott Ritter and Jerry Smith, as well as former CIA counterterrorism official Philip Giraldi, had all questioned the official narrative of what happened on April 4.

{"id": "sample_6_321", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "Correction: Following the reporting from the Week, this post originally stated that Mark Steyn had been dropped by the law firm representing him, Steptoe & Johnson. National Review publisher Jack Fowler says it was Steyn who ended the relationship, and not Steptoe & Johnson. (See below for more.)\n\nAccording to a report from the Week's Damon Linker, National Review, the leading right-wing magazine founded by William F. Buckley, is in a world of trouble — and it has one of its most popular columnists, Mark Steyn, to thank.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWrites Linker:\n\nClimate scientist Michael Mann is suing National Review and Mark Steyn, one of its leading writers, for defamation. It's a charge that's notoriously hard to prove, which is no doubt why the magazine initially refused to apologize for an item on its blog in which Steyn accused Mann of fraud. Steyn also quoted a line by another conservative writer (Rand Simberg) that called Mann \"the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data.\" (Simberg and the free market think tank for which he works, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, are also named in the suit.)\n\nAccording to Linker, National Review's requests to have the case thrown out have been rejected (emphasis mine):\n\nIn July, Judge Natalia Combs Greene rejected a motion to dismiss the suit. The defendants appealed, and last week D.C. Superior Court Judge Frederick Weisberg rejected the motion again, opening the door for the discovery phase of the lawsuit to begin. That's not all. On Christmas Eve, Steyn (who regularly guest hosts Rush Limbaugh's radio show) wrote a blog post in which he excoriated Greene, accusing her of incompetence, stupidity, and obtuseness. As a result of this outburst, the law firm that had been representing National Review and Steyn (Steptoe & Johnson) has dropped Steyn as a client and reportedly has plans to withdraw as counsel for the magazine as well. (Now representing himself in the lawsuit, non-lawyer Steyn continues on the attack here and here.) [Update: National Review publisher Jack Fowler says that it was Mark Steyn who initiated the break with the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, not the other way around.]\n\nNo matter who's representing them, however, the outlook for the folks running National Review is grim. Linker reports that, like many political magazines, National Review has a relatively small (but influential) circulation, and frequently loses money. Breaking even is a good year. Therefore, a large settlement with Mann, or a penalty handed down by a judge, could prove catastrophic.Correction: Following the reporting from the Week, this post originally stated that Mark Steyn had been dropped by the law firm representing him, Steptoe & Johnson.

{"id": "sample_6_330", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "Pin Share 27 Shares\n\nThe Authors Guild had the ground cut out from under them today in an important copyright lawsuit.\n\nThe Second Circuit of Appeals released a ruling this morning which largely upheld Judge Harold Baer's October 2012 decision in The Authors Guild v HathiTrust, and went one step better. The court affirmed that the HathiTrust's book scanning efforts were fair use, and they also ruled that The Authors Guild had no standing to sue in the first place.\n\nThe HathiTrust Digital Library is a consortium of universities and public libraries. Firmed in 2008, this group had the goal of digitizing out of print and rare tomes in their collections in order to preserve the works and make them more widely available. A number of these organizations have also participated in the similar Google Books project, but unlike Google HathiTrust has no plans to commercialize their efforts.\n\nThe Authors Guild, along author groups in Canada, Norway, Australia, and Sweden, sued the HathiTrust in 2011, alleging that the book scanning amounted to copyright infringement. In October 2012 Judge Baer ruled in favor of the HathiTrust, issuing a summary judgement which stated, in part, \"Although I recognize that the facts here may on some levels be without precedent, I am convinced that they fall safely within the protection of fair use\".\n\nThe author groups of course appealed the ruling, and today they lost.\n\nThe Appeals Court ruled that \"the doctrine of fair use allows defendants-appellees to create a full-text searchable database of copyrighted works and to provide those works in formats accessible to those with disabilities\", thus giving the HathiTrust a green light to continue their work.\n\nIn addition, the Appeals Court also sidestepped one of the issues, noting that the HathiTrust's intention to let member organizations create a replacement copy of a scanned book was outside the scope of this trial. The Appeals Court pointed out that it's not clear \"whether the plaintiffs own copyrights in any works that would be effectively irreplaceable at a fair price by the Libraries and, thus, would be potentially subject to being copied by the Libraries in case of the loss or destruction of an original\".\n\nAnd finally, the Appeals Court declined to rule on the University of Michigan's related Orphan Works Project, stating that \"the infringement claims asserted in connection with the OWP were not ripe for adjudication because the project has been abandoned and the record contained no information about whether the program will be revived and, if so, what it would look like or whom it would affect\".\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Appeals Court also ruled that 3 of the author groups who were plaintiffs (The Authors Guild, Australian Society of Authors Limited, and Writers' Union of Canada) did not have standing to sue under US law. As was pointed out by the Appeals Court, US, Canadian, and Australian copyright law \"does not permit copyright holders to choose third parties to bring suits on their behalf\". Only 4 of author groups are ruled to have standing to proceed on this claim based on their respective national copyright laws.\n\nIt's a shame no one noticed that years ago when the Google Books lawsuit was originally filed; it would have short-circuited years of litigation.\n\nPublishers Lunch\n\nruling\n\nimage by archer10 (Dennis)Pin Share 27 Shares\n\nThe Authors Guild had the ground cut out from under them today in an important copyright lawsuit.\n\nThe Second Circuit of Appeals released a ruling this morning which largely upheld Judge Harold Baer's October 2012 decision in The Authors Guild v HathiTrust, and went one step better.

In October 2012 Judge Baer ruled in favor of the HathiTrust, issuing a summary judgement which stated, in part, \"Although I recognize that the facts here may on some levels be without precedent, I am convinced that they fall safely within the protection of fair use\".\n\nThe author groups of course appealed the ruling, and today they lost.\n\nThe Appeals Court ruled that \"the doctrine of fair use allows defendants-appellees to create a full-text searchable database of copyrighted works and to provide those works in formats accessible to those with disabilities\", thus giving the HathiTrust a", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

Yet the casual observer might have missed that Obama’s relationship with the supposed liberal media often has been rocky.\n\nThat’s chiefly because Obama and his national security advisers have reiterated the disdain for reporters that for White House occupants stretches back to Richard Nixon. In The Atlantic in August 2014, Jon Marshall, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, noted, “Nixon’s way of handling the press has prevailed in American politics. Intimidating journalists, avoiding White House reporters, staging events for television — now common presidential practices — were all originally Nixonian tactics.”\n\nWe can cite three recent examples of such behavior exhibited by Obama and his staff.\n\nIn May 2013, The Associated Press announced that then-Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department had subpoenaed from telecommunications companies the home and cellphone records of 20 AP reporters. The purpose was to learn who leaked information to the AP.\n\nThat same month The Washington Post reported that Holder had declared Fox News reporter James Rosen a “criminal co-conspirator” in endorsing search warrants to obtain Rosen’s emails. Holder wanted those, and had ordered the FBI to monitor Rosen’s visits to the State Department, in suspecting a government contractor of having leaked to Rosen classified information.\n\nFinally, in January, the Justice Department announced that it would abandon a six-year crusade, which included threats of prison time, to force James Risen of The New York Times to reveal who conveyed confidential information about a Clinton administration CIA operation targeting Iran that Risen had included in a book he authored in 2006.\n\nLast month it came to light that Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently issued guidelines that said journalists in war zones, who generally are civilians, also may be “members of the armed forces, persons authorized to accompany the armed forces, or unprivileged belligerents” — which is the term the Obama administration has substituted for what the Bush administration called “unlawful enemy combatants” — that is, terrorists.\n\nJournalism outlets complained that reporters were too easily being lumped in with terrorists. The Pentagon replied that the term was being misunderstood, that they just wanted to inform military commanders that spies or terrorists sometimes can pose as reporters.\n\nAs the Committee to Protect Journalists has noted, the term is so loosely defined that military leaders could easily cite it to “detain journalists without charge, and without any apparent need to show evidence or bring a suspect to trial.” The Pentagon’s solution is worse: it suggests reporters could offer their stories to “relevant authorities” for review so as to “not reveal sensitive information to the enemy.” The choice is thus detention with no legal protections, or outright censorship.\n\nWe understand the Pentagon’s concern with safeguarding the lives of American soldiers. Yet Obama’s record on dealing with the media is not good, and his desire to plumb leaks, withhold information, or obfuscate might even make Nixon in the afterlife cringe.\n\nWe don’t want to see any troops injured or killed by what a journalist reports, but the fog of war too often conceals the truth — which, it has been said, is the first casualty. Carter and the Pentagon hierarchy should revise this language, if not scrap it, to ensure the American people are not denied the fullest picture of combat and to adhere with our constitutional protections of the media.Since his election in 2008, many on the right have believed that the news media — with the exceptions of Fox News and The Wall Street Journal — are President Barack Obama’s sycophants.\n\nSince his election in 2008, many on the right have believed that the news media — with the exceptions of Fox News and The Wall Street Journal — are President Barack Obama’s sycophants.

Find allies and accomplices.\n\nThere will be no platform for fascism in the Bay Area nor will revolutionaries be pawns in some neo-reactionary game. Our strength is exercised not just in our ability to respond and react but in our proactive autonomy that creates a cool, determined, collected atmosphere of safety and solidarity. May we humbly suggest not taking any bait but make collective decisions. Stay with your affinity group and resist the frogmen that come out from behind the keyboards. This is not a statement on any particular tactic – it’s a call for strategic engagement.\n\nSome wisdom garnered from fascist demonstrations over the least few years in California suggests that some participants on their side are easily shaken and violently react with weapons. This is to say Anti-Fascists should be aware of this in scenarios in which small numbers of boneheads/frogmen walk to and from the demonstration.\n\nWhat began as a direct response to Feb. 1st – a march for “free speech,” with the frat-brownshirt Proud Boys as special guests – has been completely rebranded since Milo’s fall from grace. Now the organizers of these “Marches 4 Trump” are trying to pull together a coalition of libertarians, ancaps, armed militias, brownshirt alt-right enforcers, the “patriotic” Tea Party crowd, and alt-lite Deplorables without alienating any of them.\n\nPeople getting organized against fascist 'Proud Boys' holding 'March 4 Trump' in #Berkeley pic.twitter.com/sF29nUxLVS — FireWorks (@FireWorksBAY) February 22, 2017\n\nRich Black is the public face of the March on Berkeley. His Twitter header is a pastel ancap flag. He neglected to make the March on Berkeley Facebook event page (or its guest list) private. In an attempt to funnel every angry conservative in California into downtown Berkeley, he (or other organizers) canceled the Sacramento and Los Angeles marches and combined them with Berkeley’s. He seems very eager to simultaneously a) reassure everyone that this is not an alt-right event and b) tag Gavin McInnes begging for promotion, retweet the Proud Boys, and tag both them and the Oath Keepers in his tweets. For someone who isn’t organizing a fascist march, he sure wants all the fascists to know about it.\n\nBlack wants his fascist cake and eat it too.\n\nThe Berkeley College Republicans, everyone’s favorite concentration of truly banal evil, will be in attendance as well. In meetings they’ve been enthusiastically hyping March 4th and are trying to get the California State Militia to show up. BCR’s alt-right and white nationalist ties are well documented and getting stronger. Jack Palkovic was spotted on BART with Identity Evropa founder Nathan Damigo. They hugged each other goodbye.\n\nThe feeling on the ground is that this is, on some level, a trap. They’re massing outside the police station. The cops are ready to protect these fascists, and they aren’t going to be hands-off this time. Camera-hungry Milo counter-protesters like Eddie Brock show up in Rich Black’s Twitter conversations. They call themselves a march, but there’s no parade route even being discussed. Their organizers claim to be working with police, militias, and the FBI. And they’re expecting antifascist resistance. They’ve been circulating our calls to action, warning each other that the spectre of antifa will be back to haunt them.\n\nSo show up and haunt these motherfuckers. Bring your friends. Give ’em hell, but be careful. Berkeley is the hill that the alt-right and their growing coalition have chosen to flounder on, and they’re only getting cockier.\n\nWe shut these fascists down before, and we’ll do it again.On March 4th, 2017 – 2 PM, at the Peace Wall in Berkeley, CA fascists are coming back.

{"id": "sample_6_362", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " “Private Industry Safeguards Act,” a model policy of the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, which purports to advance free-market priorities in the statehouses, has been recommended to the organization’s enormous body of state-level lawmakers from across the country since 2002. More than 20 states have prohibitions on municipal broadband on the books.\n\nAll this may sound pretty rich at a time when internet providers have effective monopolies in many regions and rates rise faster than download speeds. But to critics, publicly owned broadband could well be the thin end of the socialist wedge.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission disagrees. Last year, in response to a petition from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, the FCC decided to pre-empt portions of those states’ laws that restricted the build-out of those cities’ broadband networks. With FCC protection, the cities would have been able to expand their super-fast fiber service into adjoining municipalities and rural areas.\n\nHere’s how the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals summarized the FCC argument that the rollout of fiber internet by Chattanooga’s Electric Power Board fostered competition: “In response to the EPB’s constructing its fiber network, Comcast stopped raising its rates—which had risen sharply for years—and subsequently reduced them. Both of the private providers in the EPB’s electric service area, Comcast and AT&T, have vastly improved their Internet download speeds since the EPB’s entry. This demonstrates the benefits of increased broadband competition and how a possible expansion for the EPB could promote such competition.” An independent analysis estimated Chattanooga’s network had produced at least 2,800 jobs and $865 million in benefits for the city.\n\nThe states sued the FCC, and early last month, they won: The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC had overstepped its bounds. The court found that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 didn’t offer the commission clear authority to pre-empt state law.\n\nIt was a legal defeat, but a limited one. While the court ruled against the FCC, it didn’t see any faults with their reason for acting: “We do not question the public benefits that the FCC identifies in permitting municipalities to expand Gigabit Internet coverage,” the decision reads.\n\nIt’s another notch for the consensus that municipal broadband introduces competition to an industry too often lacking it. “If the private sector were solving this problem, cities wouldn’t be doing this,” says Deb Socia, the executive chairman of Next Century Cities, a coalition of cities that advocates for municipal broadband as a local option, among other issues.*\n\nBarring an act of Congress to modify FCC powers (don’t hold your breath), the battle returns to the statehouses. But it won’t be as hopeless there as many local control issues are. In most cases, pre-emption disputes pit rural Republican state legislators against progressive urban policies like the minimum wage or a fracking ban. In Tennessee and North Carolina, there’s a twist: Chattanooga and Wilson already have high-speed internet, both public and private. It’s their rural neighbors that suffer from telecom companies’ reluctance to expand good service into low-density areas.\n\nIn Tennessee, for example, municipal broadband remains legal—but expanding it beyond the provider’s existing coverage area is not allowed. Chattanoogans are allowed to keep their lightning-fast internet; it’s residents outside the EPB’s coverage area that suffer. “For several years we’ve been fielding requests from neighboring communities who have hardly had access, asking: ‘Would you guys bring services to us?’ ” explains Danna Bailey, vice president of communications at EPB. “And we’ve said: ‘We’d love to, but Tennessee state law prohibits it.’”\n\nThat turns the traditional political calculus of state-vs.-city pre-emption bills on its head. In Tennessee, a state law to loosen the regulation of public broadband is being sponsored by a pair of Republicans: Sen. Janice Bowling and Rep. Kevin Brooks. And it was a Republican state senator, Todd Gardenhire of Chattanooga, who said earlier this year, “AT&T is the villain here.”\n\nProponents of public broadband see a parallel to the rollout of the electrical grid, which ignored rural areas in favor of population clusters where electricity provision was more profitable. “We see broadband in the 21st century as electricity was in the 20th,” said. Bailey. “To participate in this economy you’ve got to have access. Consumers are really starting to demand it, so legislators are hearing from their constituents: ‘I’ve got to have broadband.

{"id": "sample_6_378", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " Obama's orders two weeks before the Regime slaughtered his son and eight other innocent people.\n\nSeeking to justify the murder of a child, the Obama administration circulated the story that the 16-year-old was actually an adult \"suspected\" of being a \"militant.\"\n\nThat story was refined somewhat once it was proven that Abdulrahman was a teenager. However, the administration has never dropped the pretense that the summary execution of that innocent U.S. citizen was, in some sense, a strategic success. Since the Regime killed him — and, in its sovereign wisdom, the Regime never errs — the young man simply couldn’t be innocent.\n\nWithin a day of the Movie Theater Massacre, the murderer of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki announced that he would travel to Colorado to bless the traumatized city of Aurora with his healing presence.\n\n\"[W]e may never understand what leads anyone to terrorize their fellow human beings,\" intoned the death-dealing divinity in the Oval Office in his July 21 weekly radio address. \"Such evil is senseless — beyond reason.\"\n\nWe're invited to believe that the routine state terrorism committed by Obama and the government over which he presides is both sensible and rational.\n\nApparently there is something noble and redemptive about commissioning a legion of chair-moistening joystick jockeys who — enthroned in the climate-controlled safety of well-guarded office buildings in Nevada and Virginia — dispatch robot aircraft to annihilate innocent strangers in places like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.\n\nWhen drone-fired missiles wipe out wedding parties and funerals; when drone operators exploit the panic and chaos of an initial strike to stage follow-up attacks targeting emergency personnel — these acts are consecrated by the Dear Leader's approval, and thus cannot be compared to the rampage committed by a private individual responsible for killing a dozen people and wounding scores of others in Aurora.\n\nIn order to clarify this vital distinction, it's useful to recall the comments of Dear Leader Emeritus Bill Clinton from an interview published in the December 2009 issue of Foreign Policy. Asked to elucidate this important matter, Clinton helpfully defined terrorism as “killing and robbery and coercion by people who do not have state authority….”(Emphasis added.) By reverse-engineering this definition we learn that “killing and robbery and coercion” carried out in the name of “state authority” isn’t terrorism; it’s public policy.\n\nAs it happens, Anwar al-Awlaki — although described as a supporter of al-Qaeda — was a forthright opponent of terrorist attacks against American civilians.\n\nIn a typical address he stated that the U.S. government's role in invading and occupying Muslim countries \"does not justify the killing of one U.S. civilian in New York City or Washington, D.C.,\" just as the murder of thousands of civilians in New York and Washington do not \"justify the death of one civilian in Afghanistan.\"\n\nAwlaki believed that all people — including Muslims — have the right to defend themselves against aggressive violence, and was not diffident in expressing that view. By presidential decree, the expression of those views was made a capital offense. The sentence was imposed not by a court of law, but through the deliberations of a secretive, anonymous, unaccountable panel. There was certainly a great deal of \"efficiency\" in this arrangement — but not so much as a hint or whisper of due process.\n\nIn a March 5 address that was an exercise in unalloyed sophistry, Attorney General Eric Holder told an audience at Northwestern University Law School that \"due process\" doesn't require \"judicial process.\" During congressional testimony two days later, FBI Director Robert Mueller was asked about Eric Holder's position, and whether it applied to the execution of American citizens on presidential orders. He artlessly ducked the question by objecting that he would \"have to go back\" and check if that was addressed in administration policy. In the intervening months, Mueller has not found the time to report what he has learned.\n\nThe rationale for the existence of political government is the belief — as unsupported by empirical evidence as it is impervious to it — that concentrating power in an entity claiming a monopoly on aggressive violence will protect the innocent. The massacre in Aurora, like every other incident in which an armed criminal preys upon a confined audience of unarmed, innocent people, underscored the fact that the police are, at best, useless in such situations.\n\nThe police arrived while the rampage was in progress. Police recordings captured the sound of gunfire and screaming while officers waited outside the theater, setting up a \"perimeter\" and waiting for gas masks to be distributed. The assailant ended the slaughter on his own terms; the police did nothing to stop or minimize the carnage. Their mission was successful, however, since none of them was injured.\n", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_381", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " attackers stormed the house.\n\nThe boy was in the kitchen and as he turned to get his first soft drink from the refrigerator, he heard a knock on the door. Framed in a window, he saw a black man standing there, with a gun pointed directly at him. The door was open and the attacker entered. The black man then whistled and four other black men appeared, armed with guns and knives.\n\nHis father was relieved that they did not lay a finger on Jodré. FWM learned that his son escaped unharmed because he had managed to stay calm. They tied the boy to a chair at the safe and demanded the keys, but he did not know where it was.\n\nThe black assailants then ransacked every room, and tore into the ceilings in order to look for hiding places of valuables. The attackers eventually broke the safe from the wall and managed to cut it open.\n\nLubbe says they were clearly interested in guns and money, although they also stole other items. But he also says the assailants knew the house quite well. He believes they must have been watching the family’s home because they knew a lot about their movements. “It just shows you, they watch you,” he says.\n\nA security company, Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit and Bossies Community Justice joined the SAPS in searching the bush into which the suspects had fled.\n\nMbombela police spokesman, Capt Dawie Pretorius, told The Lowvelder that the dog unit joined the search but it was called off when they lost their tracks on the N4 highway. This suggests that the assailants had a getaway vehicle waiting for them and that their attack had been well prepared.\n\nAccording to Pretorius, the aggressors broke open the safe and made off with two pistols, a shotgun and an air gun.\n\n“It could have been much worse,” André believes. “We were lucky. If I had driven back to the house earlier, it could have been much worse.”\n\nThe murder of Mark Hadiaris\n\nFor the latest farm attack survivor, Sue Hadiaris (49) it has actually been much worse.\n\nShe told The Lowvelder, a community newspaper, that she still remembered looking down the long barrel of a big black gun. The black assailant pointing the weapon at her, was tall and thin with sharp facial features. His partner’s gun resembled his. The two had just coldly slain her husband, Mark (55), 30 minutes earlier.\n\n“Take off your clothes. We want to rape you,” the one attacker told her, moments before she was able to reach for the security panic button. If she had not called for help in pressing the button at that moment, she would have been killed too, she believes.\n\nThe farm attack on Heidelberg Farm happened in the early hours of the morning when two black men charged the couple, who were enjoying the weather in the garden, and forced them into the house at gunpoint.\n\nMark ran towards the bedroom, but his assailants followed him and shot Mark in the chest. He died instantly. According to Warrant Officer Gugu Phiri, spokesman for White River Police Station, the strike happened at around 02:00.\n\nThen the pair assaulted Sue with what was presumably a sharpened screwdriver to gain access to the safe and stole all the valuables as well as cellphones.\n\nSue was then ordered to undress. She realised that they were planning to rape her, but managed to reach the panic button, a friend says. Thanks to her move, a security company called Full Circle arrived just minutes later and the assailants fled before they could carry out their threat.\n\nThe police and the security company’s owner, Jan Barnard, thoroughly investigated the scene, but the bullet that killed Mark was not found, even though the bullet had exited his body. This suggests that the farm attackers were well-trained not to leave behind incriminating evidence.\n\nSue sustained serious injuries to her hand and was taken to Nelspruit MediClinic via ambulance after she had been rescued.\n\nIn yet another incident, in a joint operation between a number of security companies, the police and members of the community arrested ten black attackers on Friday. It is believed that the black gang was responsible for a farm attack in the Lydenburg/Stofberg area in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\nThe victims, all white, were later treated for knife wounds at Middelburg Hospital.\n\nProvincial police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe, said law enforcement had received a tip-off and had set a trap. Not long after, several assailants, travelling in an Audi believed to have been stolen during the farm attack, were apprehended. Shortly afterwards, another four travelling in a rented Volkswagen Polo were arrested in the", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_386", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " storm in a few seasons, it may not be essential with larger problems at hand.\n\nThe Arizona Coyotes tallied only 170 goals this season which places them 29th in the league in that category. Offense seems to be an issue for Arizona so passing on Hanifin may be an option on June 26th.\n\nPosition: Center Games Played: 68 Goals: 45 Assists: 84 Points:129\n\nDylan Strome is a pure playmaker that is ready to step up and play at the next level. Strome lead the entire Ontario Hockey League with 129 points this season, proving that he can light up the score sheet. Dylan has a strong knowledge of the ice and an alert vision which ultimately led him to the lead the league in assists with 84. His offensive awareness is top notch and he enjoys having the puck on his stick.\n\nWhen asked about who he looks up to, Strome mentions Joe Thornton due to his soft hands and physicality. Dylan is very beneficial to his team in the faceoff circle as he wins a vast majority of draws. Dylan comes from a hockey family as well with his brother Ryan Strome currently playing for the New York Islanders. Strome’s knowledge is a key component in his high draft stock.\n\nThere are a few criticisms pertaining to the OHL’s leading scorer. Playing alongside Connor McDavid can easily make someone better and that has definitely been the case for Dylan Strome. With that being said, critics are wondering how Strome will perform without McDavid on his line. Well, without McDavid in the lineup Strome put up 35 points in 21 games. Playing without McDavid does not seem to be a problem.\n\nSteve Kournianos of The Draft Analyst had this to say about Dylan:\n\n“Strome’s elite play with the puck and the way he protects it can make attempts at slowing him down both futile and nightmarish. He’s a hard match up who can carve up any game plan with precision puck movement. He’s excellent at creating plays off the rush, but he also excels when the game is tightly checked and every lane is seemingly clogged. It is in the offensive zone where he uses his size, reach and elite vision to his advantage. He’s is a precise passer and gifted playmaker who epitomizes opportunistic; make a bad decision with him on the ice, and there’s a good chance you’re going pay for it.”\n\nIs Dylan Strome the answer to Arizona’s scoring problem? Having the leading scorer of the OHL would certainly be a great starting point in the Coyotes rebuild. The probability of Strome playing in the NHL next season is low as it seems like he may need to sharpen his skills a little bit more with Erie. With that being said, having a superstar playmaker to set up players like Mikkel Boedker and Max Domi will be a huge threat in the future. His offensive awareness would be something that the Coyotes desperately need.\n\nPosition: Right Wing Games Played: 63 Goals: 44 Assists: 82 Points: 126\n\nMitch Marner has slowly climbed up the draft ladder as he was not expected to be a third overall pick at the beginning of the season. Marner has proved that he has what it takes to compete at the next level with his prolific offensive performance with London this year. Mitch would finish second behind Dylan Strome for the OHL scoring title at 126 points. Mitch is also the first player in London to reach a 100 point season since John Tavares in 2008.\n\nMitch Marner makes scoring look easy with his speed and ability to control the puck. He enjoys having the puck on his stick when entering the offensive zone in order to snipe one past the goaltender. Mitch is also recognized as a relentless forechecker and attacker. Marner compares himself to Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks and tries to model his game after him.\n\nOne of the reasons that a few analysts would pass on Mitch Marner would be due to his size. He is 5’11” and 160 pounds which isn’t necessarily ideal in the NHL. On the other hand, many players already in the league have a size limitation and that does not stop them. Tyler Johnson of the Tampa Bay Lightning currently leads the 2015 NHL Playoffs with 21 points at only 5’9″ and 175 pounds. Patrick Kane is a close second with 20 points in the playoffs at 5’11”. Size does not matter if you know how to use it and Mitch Marner certainly knows how to use his. There is a high possibility that he will hit another growth spurt before the year is over too.\n\nCurtis Joe of EliteProspects describes Mitch Marner as:\n\n“A dynamic offensive forward that backchecks hard and establishes his presence through playing smart, puck-possession hockey.

{"id": "sample_6_397", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " based upon one of the most popular (and hardest) Vocaloid songs in Japanese history. The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku is a solid light novel with a few surprisingly heartfelt moments sprinkled within the pages.\n\nThe Disappearance of Hatsune Miku revolves around the life of Shinosato Asano, a reserved university student that works at a research lab and part time at a nightclub. One day, his professor assigns him a mysterious task: he must conduct a field test for an android named Hatsune Miku. While the task is open-ended, Asano initially struggles to interact with the robot, and it doesn’t help matters when his friends Kurose Aika and Ishiii Juhachi wonder what he’s doing with a girl who looks like a fish out of water. Within a couple of weeks, however, Asano and Miku form a bond as they become intertwined with each other; however, Miku holds some devious secrets that may change Asano’s life forever.\n\nThe novel’s chapters are separated by date and time, with the main story focusing on Asano’s point-of-view. His first interactions with Miku are weird and jilted, but it’s understandable due to his somewhat timid personality. He struggles to open up to her, and his character development is actually quite heartwarming, if somewhat tragic near the end. In addition, I really enjoyed the supporting cast of Asano’s friends; Aika is the resident shipper-on-deck who provides some comic relief, while Juhachi is the tough guy dropout that’s sometimes too confident for his own good. The trio play off each other’s personalities really well, and I love the best friends dynamic they share.\n\nIt was quite interesting to see how the author portrayed Miku (who doesn’t have a canon personality due to her being, well, synthetic). Here, she’s peppy and charismatic, attracting those around her with her signature outfit and singing voice. Near the end, however, her character morphs into something more robotic and stoic, which marks the change of tone in the novel. The story does reference some of the more well-known aspects of her character (such as her trademark hair and food, as well as the fact that she had multiple “voices” in an update to the Vocaloid software). While many liberties are made in order to explain the technology to create her, the story does note her limitations as an android.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about Disappearance was how the authors could extrapolate so much story out of a single song. [email protected], the artist who created the eponymous song, took great lengths to explain the true meaning behind The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku. Essentially, the song marks Miku’s existential crisis as she “dies” throughout it, slowly losing control as well as her memories. To be fair, the song is filled with motor mouth exposition, as this English cover demonstrates, so it’s not like there’s a scant amount of lyrics here.\n\nWhile Disappearance does move at a brisk pace due to the medium, the first third of the book was a bit slow to build up. We get the generic “boy meets girl” plot for the first eighty or so pages, with Asano struggling to come up with activities to do with Miku, and coming up with increasingly absurd reasons as to why he’s hanging out with her. By the time the story moves out of the introductions, however, it really picks up, with the second half correlating to the events of the titular song.\n\nWhen the overall novel shifts from a romantic slice-of-life to a science-fiction drama, it becomes much more thrilling. However, near the end it starts to go into a slight cosmic horror plot, which doesn’t mesh well with the rest of the story. It comes out of nowhere, and the resolution appears just as quickly. Keeping the story firmly into softer science-fiction/slice-of-life territory would have been preferable to the last dozen or so pages. A small point to note with the translation is that it does contain a few grammatical errors at times. They’re noticeable but not dealbreaking; still, it’s something that should probably be tightened up in future printings.\n\n75 Good The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku Review Guidelines While a bit inconsistent with translation and pacing, The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku is a poignant and heartwarming light novel that explores Japan’s virtual pop superstar in a surprisingly human way. Just make sure to bring tissues near the end of it. —Elisha Deogracias\n\nElisha Deogracias is an aspiring accountant by day, freelance writer by night.

He said he is working on various options and will announce a decision soon.\n\nThis stands in contrast to what the Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Dion said on Monday, when he announced that the combat mission would end imminently.\n\n“It will be a matter of weeks not months,” Dion told reporters. Dion also said pulling out Canada’s jets would be done in conjunction with Canada’s allies and rolled out alongside a new plan, but he never hinted that the defining issue would be “capability.”\n\nSajjan also said he is considering leaving Canada’s air refueling and reconnaissance aircraft as part of the mission.\n\nThe Conservative defence critic James Bezan responded to Sajjan, demanding to see the details of the Liberal plan for the military mission. He believes there have been contradictory messages sent about the nature of the mission and whether the Liberal government will eventually put more boots on the ground.\n\n“I’m looking forward to seeing exactly what the plan is because that wasn’t apparent,” says Bezan. “The defence minister is using language that’s quite different from what we’re hearing from the Prime Minister,” he said.\n\nBezan said the Prime Minister has said in the House that Canada needs to fight ISIS in its own territory. “Does that mean boots on the ground?” he asked.\n\nThe defence minister joined Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Pearson airport on Thursday night to greet the incoming Syrian refugees, but Sajjan says the government is trying to avoid using military bases to house more refugees.\n\n“We are trying to, hopefully, not even be able to use military bases, but if it’s needed, we are available for that purpose,” the minister said.\n\nToday the threat level from ISIS was raised in Geneva after suspects related to the Paris attacks are being tracked by police, but the defence minister maintains his previous statement that Canada has nothing to fear from ISIS.\n\n“Canada should not fear ISIS, and I am firm believer in that,” he said. “Canadians should feel safe but that does not mean that we are going to eliminate all threats, but we have security forces that 24/7 are looking out for these types of threats,” he said.\n\nSajjan also said his most important job is protecting the mental health of the men and women in the Canadian military.\n\nThe comments came in a wide ranging interview ton “Everything is Political” that covered new money in the budget for the military, sexual misconduct in the forces, and Canada’s support for the Afghan police force.\n\nThe entire interview can be heard by clicking on the link below or by subscribing to the “Everything is Political podcast here..No timetable on pulling jets, says Defence Minister\n\nDefence Minister Harjit Sajjan\n\nCanada will not pull its CF-18 fighter jets from the combat mission in Iraq and Syria if it degrades the overall capability of the coalition forces, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told SiriusXM in an interview on “Everything in Political with Evan Solomon.”\n\n“The decision for that will be based on my conversations with my counterparts, making sure that the coalition’s capability is not reduced,” the defence minister said.

{"id": "sample_6_412", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " about it, seems like a really good reason to do something different, even if that something is going home. Sometime in the last year or two my previously steadfast resistance to going home started to soften. Last May, when my boss proposed I come back to Sunnyvale, which is now where most of our senior execs are based, I found myself much more receptive to the idea than I would have expected.\n\nThere is no greater message behind our departure. I’m not disappointed in China. I haven’t been involved in public slanging matches with any Chinese celebrities. There is no shroud of legal action looming above me. I am, in fact, profoundly grateful to have been able to live and work in China for as long as I have. We all take it for granted, and piss and moan about the air and traffic and censored Internet and sketchy food because that’s our version of water-cooler sports talk. And we all rationalize a bit to be here. But step back and think about it for a moment. From your average suburban American perspective, who gets to live in China? Nobody, that’s who. It’s the stuff of fantasy and scarcely-believable tales from exotic relatives, like my mysterious uncle Stephen, who lived and worked in Hong Kong in the late 1980s. It has been a gift, and under other circumstances I would have remained here at least for a while.\n\nBut I was never in danger of staying forever, and nor are most other western expats. That’s why I was amused by the mass fluster that surrounded the public departures of Mark Kittoand Charlie Custer. All of a sudden foreigners were abandoning China! I know and like both Mark and Charlie, and admittedly much of the fluster was within our particular echo chamber, but, seriously, coverage in the New York Times, BusinessWeek and The Economist? Both of their personal experiences can be used to tell larger stories about life and power and business in China (and maybe I’m just jealous that my own departure is about as newsworthy as a bad air day), and both of their articles were great reads. But “foreigner departs China” is the very definition of dog-bites-man. The satirical site China Daily Show nailed it with a funny “dear John” letter from a foreigner to China.\n\n“Foreigner stays in China,” now that’s a story. For an increasingly cosmopolitan and globally interconnected country, China isn’t really a place encourages foreigners to settle down. In fact, it goes out of its way to keep us at arm’s length. I should make a collage out of eight years of temporary residence certificates arranged around the confession I had to sign for registering my son’s birth with the police a few weeks late. Economic migrants bleed across the borders in search of something better, and perhaps some Vietnamese mail-order brides wind up here for the long haul, but in general foreigners don’t immigrate to China. We just visit, sometimes for a very long time.\n\nIn the end, there are only two possible outcomes for a foreigner in China: you either stay here for the rest of your life, or, sooner or later, you leave. If you were to diagram it, it would look something like this:\n\nThat little dot encompasses the handful of old communists who settled here for ideological reasons, such as Israel Epstein and Sidney Shapiro, and maybe Carl Crook, who was born in Beijing. One or two businessmen I’ve met have been here for thirty or more years, and a couple of journalists I know are edging in that direction. Maybe Kaiser is here forever(though I doubt it). But even Sidney Rittenberg, famously “The Man Who Stayed Behind,” didn’t actually stay behind. He retired to Washington State in 1980. Of course, he was thrown in jail in China. Twice. You’d probably retire to Washington State, too. According to the People’s Daily, China has granted permanent residency to less than 5000 foreigners since it started doing so in 2004, and it made the news when Shanghai issued its first batch of green cards in 2005. It’s a safe bet that granting citizenship is even rarer.\n\nWe leave. That’s what we do. But just because leaving China is normal doesn’t mean something isn’t going on. Among my friends there has been a tangible change in mood in the last couple of years. A sense of excitement about being here that endured for many years has in many cases given way to a sense of weariness or indifference. The most common reaction when I tell people my company is moving me back to California is, “you’re so lucky!”\n\nThere’s nothing sinister happening.

I don't see anything particularly different this year except for the visa issue.\n\nEverything points to a steady growth for the industry,\" said the former President of the Confederation of Indian Industry.\n\n\"If the global GDP grows around 2-3 per cent, (global) IT investment will grow around 3-5 per cent and Indian IT will grow about 4-5 per cent higher than that. So, it (Indian IT industry) will grow around 9-10 per cent (in 2017-18).\"\n\nHe said the current fiscal is not going to be the most challenging for the IT industry, noting the financial crisis in 2008 had brought the growth rate to almost zero then.\n\nIn the era of digitisation, Indian companies are moving in that space, where new firms are also emerging.\n\nClients and the industry are increasing investments into some of the new technologies, he said.\n\nHiring in the IT sector has come down because of slower growth rate, and increasing automation on some types of services such as infrastructure management and testing, he said.\n\nOn salaries of entry-level IT engineers not seeing hike in recent years, Gopalakrishnan said it's a function of supply and demand, and the industry had a large supply and so the salaries are modestly growing.\n\nHe said Indian IT engineers also need to move into user industries such as retail manufacturing, healthcare and financial services which require larges-scale IT deployment.\n\nThey also need to look at opportunities such as those in product companies and firms providing services on the cloud which require \"unique and specialised skills\".\n\nHe did not agree with perception in some quarters that India is \"pleading\" with the US on the visa issue.\n\n\"This is a trade issue. We have certain strengths which we need to leverage. Services is our strength. Having said that, we need to look at new models, we need to look at how the industry can transform. I see this happening. Lot more US companies are setting up IT operations in India. So, the companies are shifting to India,\" Gopalakrishnan said.\n\nThere have been apprehensions that under the new administration in US, there may be a clamp down on H1B visas which can hurt Indian IT industry. The US is the largest market for Indian IT-ITes firms.\n\nH1-B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies, including those from India, depend on it for hiring tens of thousands of employees each year.Uncertainty on the visa front is the main challenge for India's Information Technology sector in 2017-18 but it's going to be business as usual otherwise, said industry veteran Kris Gopalakrishnan.\n\n\"The challenge mainly arises because of uncertainties on the visa front (emanating from US),\" the co-founder and former CEO of Infosys told PTI in an interview, discussing prospects of IT industry in the new financial year.\n\n\"That's one challenge I see.

(Photo: Lloyd Gallman/Advertiser)Buy Photo\n\nDevelopers plan to press on with the restoration of the historic Webber Building in downtown Montgomery despite a partial building collapse Thursday that has left surrounding streets blocked indefinitely.\n\n\"Certainly, this is a setback, but I'm of the belief that it is not insurmountable,\" said David Payne Sr., owner of the building and president of Design Build South LLC., which is handling the restoration.\n\nNo one was injured when the northeast corner of the building collapsed early Thursday afternoon, although workers said they just barely escaped in time.\n\nStructural engineers were at the scene of the more than 150-year-old building at Perry and Monroe streets Thursday, Payne said. They will make a recommendation at some point about how feasible the restoration is, he added.\n\nThe cause of the collapse was not immediately clear, although workers were installing windows at the basement level and some workers on the scene said that the chain reaction of the collapse might have started there.\n\nThe following streets will be closed indefinitely: Perry Street from Dexter Avenue to Madison Avenue and Monroe Street from Perry to First Alabama Plaza.\n\nTim Brown said he and several others were working on the second floor on the other side of the building from the collapse when he saw a cloud of smoke and heard someone shouting, \"get out of the building.\"\n\nHe said he and the other workers escaped from the building just in time and that the section that collapsed \"fell in while we (were) running out.\"\n\n\"It was a spooky situation, I can tell you that,\" Brown said.\n\nMontgomery Fire and Rescue received the call of the collapse at 1:17 p.m. and nine units were dispatched to the scene, according to District Fire Chief Ronnie Bozeman.\n\nAbout 15 workers were inside at the time, including four in the basement, according to workers at the scene.\n\nPayne said the building superintendent, Brian Brakenhoff, saw a crack in the wall and heard or saw a brick pop out, and that he acted quickly to get everyone out of the building.\n\n\"It is a miracle today that no one was injured,\" Payne said. \"When I first heard the news, I was sure that someone was killed.\"\n\nThe two buildings west of the Webber have also been evacuated until a construction engineer can deem their structural safety.\n\nThe air quality was checked by Hazmat and is clear of any hazardous gases.\n\nResidents are urged to keep their distance and keep outside of the collapse zone, which is deemed to be one and half the size of the structure.\n\nPayne said, however, that so much work had already been done on the building that it appears to be salvageable.\n\n\"We were well into the construction, repair and restoration of the building, so it looks like now we just have an exterior wall to repair,\" he said.\n\nPayne said the building is too much of a gem and has too much history for him to abandon the project.\n\nThe Webber Building was the home of the Montgomery Theater starting in 1860, according to the Landmarks Foundation. It's where actor John Wilkes Booth once performed and where the notes for the song \"Dixie\" were first written down.\n\nAfter the theater closed in 1907, it became Webber's Department Store until that closed in the late 1990s. The building sat deteriorating under a collapsing roof until the Montgomery Riverfront Development Foundation purchased the building for $325,000 in 2001.\n\nPayne signed an agreement to purchase the building from the Montgomery Riverfront Development Foundation about four years ago.\n\nThe renovation of the building includes plans for retail space on the first floor, office space on the second floor and apartments on the third floor.\n\nThe Landmarks Foundation offered some words of encouragement for Payne in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Landmarks has suffered similar setbacks during renovation efforts in the past. Knox Hall, an 1848 building on Perry Street, was damaged by fire in the 1980s. Local historian Mary Ann Neeley commented, 'Landmarks was not daunted by the setback, and now Knox Hall is standing tall and glorious today,' \" the statement reads.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2014/06/26/webber-building-in-downtown-montgomery-collapses/11413313/CLOSE Details about the Webber Building collapse.

But I can say one thing: I’m no devil. The public may think that but eventually everyone will get a better understanding of the situation and that image will change.”\n\nBruyneel was removed as manager of the RadioShack squad in October following the publication of USADA’s Reasoned Decision on the Armstrong case. He is mentioned repeatedly in USADA’s dossier on the doping culture in place on the US Postal Service team.\n\nA nine-page section titled “Johan Bruyneel’s involvement in doping” includes rigorous detail of the Belgian’s organisation of the doping programme at the team and states: “The overwhelming evidence in this case is that Johan Bruyneel was intimately involved in all significant details of the US Postal team’s doping program […] He was on top of the details for organising blood transfusion programs before the major Tours, and he knew when athletes needed to take EPO to regenerate their blood supply after extracting blood.”\n\nBruyneel did not refute those allegations outright in the Humo interview, but he did deny that he had placed his riders’ health at risk. “These accusations hit me very heavily and when my mother calls me in tears because she has read something bad about me, that breaks my heart,” Bruyneel said. “I can look anyone in the eye, I’ve never put anyone’s health at risk.”\n\nBruyneel also expressed his belief that the details of US Postal’s doping programme would never have been uncovered had Armstrong not come out of retirement in 2009 and had RadioShack offered Floyd Landis a contract in 2010. Landis’ emails to USADA in April 2010 triggered the federal and sporting investigations into the US Postal Service team that ultimately led to Armstrong being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life.\n\n“If Armstrong had not come back and if I had included Landis in the squad again, all of this would never have happened. I am two hundred percent convinced of that. Without those two facts, we would be talking completely differently,” Bruyneel said.Former US Postal Service and RadioShack manager Johan Bruyneel has said that he would like to speak publicly about his role in the Lance Armstrong affair but his lawyers have told him not to.

I can’t say that I’ll never start it up again, but for now, I’ve set it aside.

The Telugu film industry is the most prolific film industry in the world itself. If India produces the world���s most number of films, it is Telugu films in the country which top the list.Statistics available show that between April 2013 and March 2014, a total of 1966 films were made in India. Out of this, 349 were Telugu films, topping the list of films produced.Considering that the long drought of the coveted best national film award had eluded the Telugu film industry, the producer of ���Baahubali��� was naturally elated after the award was announced.���Winning the 63rd National Award for the best film is a huge achievement. Being the first Telugu Film to do so makes it all the more special!��� producer of ���Baahubali��� Shobhu Yarlagadda said. Prasad Devineni and K Raghavendra Rao are the other producers of the film.The epic movie set in the mythical ���Mahismathi��� kingdom in India wowed audiences across India and abroad too. Made with an estimated budget of Rs 120 crore, it is said the film garnered revenue up to Rs 600 cr.The film fascinated audiences because of its visual effects. The fact that producer Shobhu Yarlagadda acknowledged Srinivas Mohan who oversaw the visual effects speaks for the visual delight the movie was. The award means recognition for the producers.The best director award, however, has eluded S S Rajamouli who has literally worked magic at the box-office with the film.Till late in the afternoon, Rajamouli did not react about the national award on his twitter account. His last tweet was on March 25 appreciating the released recently film 'Oopiri' starring Nagarjuna and directed by Vamsi. The lead actor of the film Prabhas retweeted all the congratulatory messages which poured in, including from Anuskha Shetty, who also featured in the film. Another actor Rana Dabbubati who also featured in the movie was excited about the film getting the award.Actress Tamannaah Bhatia was also all excited about 'Baahubali' winning the award. ���Congratulations to our lovely team,��� she tweeted. ���This is awesome, awesome, awesome,��� said well-known director Krish Jagarlamudi about 'Baahubali' winning the best national film award. Actresses Samantha Ruth Prabhu also congratulated the team.Actor NTR Jr also congratulated the team. ���Congratulations to team Baahubali and Rajamouli scoring the prestigious national award for the best film. A big win for Telugu cinema,��� he said.The announcement of the national film awards brought cheer to Krish Jagarlamudi also as the film that he directed ���Kanche��� won the best film in Telugu category. The film produced by Y Rajeev Reddy and J Sai Babu featured Varun Tej and Pragya Jaiswal.'Kanche' came as a refreshing change on the Telugu screen as it was set in the 1930s. The film woven around World War-11 and has love as the primary theme. The protagonist joins the British Indian Army and comes out as strong drama. Part of the film was shot in Georgia.Kanche was made with a budget of Rs 21 crore reportedly made double its investment. For three years from 2009-11, there was no award given for best film in Telugu but from the years 2012 till date, a Telugu film was able to get a best Telugu film award. If the jury considers that none of the films submitted are good enough, they do not give a best film award in the regional language films category.'Baahubali ��� the beginning' produced by Shobhu Yarlagadda and directed by S S Rajamouli won the honours at the awards which were announced on Monday.

{"id": "sample_6_436", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "'t know anything but Math, Science, random shit, anime, and video games. I made this thread in order to get some help but first let me explain the situation:My IGN is EternaLEnVy in HoN and DotA and my SC2 name is YanagiNagi. I have not played SC2 since July, and HoN since August of 2010. I played DotA for a few weeks in August of this year but haven't really played seriously since probably mid 2008. I played mid solo for DWi (Deal With It) and was rank 2 on the ladder for a few months in HoN. I won one major tournament under this team and placed fairly high in every other. I believe this team is called Complexity now. I was rank 2 in DotA Cash Tier 2 (under Aisaka_Taiga) while I was messing around for a few weeks in august but I doubt that actually matters.OK SO ENOUGH OF THAT HERE IS THE SITUATION:I'm a 2nd year Engineering Science Student at the University of Toronto. It's basically this extremely fucking retarded course that destroys your soul:\n\nAlthough I'm doing decently in this program (low 80 average ish), I've decided that before starting the 2nd half of 2nd year, to go on \"leave\" and start playing DotA seriously. Basically I can come back to school if I fail miserably. To make money I plan on streaming (10-13 hours a day every day), coaching (not sure how this works), and winning tournaments. If I end up failing miserably in gaming I can go back to school.\n\nHERE ARE MY CONCERNS:\n\n1. Streaming.\n\nWhere do I stream? I was originally thinking of Justin.TV but then I heard of a site called Own3d from my friend that apparently pays better. I would appreciate it if anyone could compare these two sites for me.\n\nMy second concern in streaming is in money. On Justin.TV you get $0.002 for every ad you show a viewer, so basically $2 for every ad given 1000 viewers. Some people have further extrapolated this to 4 games/hour in SC2 and thus $8 every hour. This worries me because DotA games last much longer, probably would take 45minutes on average to find a game, pick, and play. I'm also not too sure about the math being used here, do people really only show one ad after every game? Say I show an ad after I finish a game and another b4 my 2nd game starts, would this be frowned upon? I don't watch DotA 2 streams so if anyone could tell me how it works that would be great.\n\n2. Canada Sucks\n\nStreaming in Canada fucking sucks. Our internet is overpriced and we don't get enough bandwidth or options. But honestly I know nothing about any of this stuff so I'm here to get input. I'm willing to pay more for better internet service but I'm stuck with Rogers for another 2 years I believe due to a contract. What internet speed do I need to play while streaming and not lag. How much bandwidth would I need to stream 12 hours per day every day for a month. And if possible, help me choose a plan that would be able to solve this issue. I also hear that you could call up rogers and make a deal with them, if anyone knows anything about this please comment.\n\nThose two are my main concerns other than personal ones. If anyone knows anything else I should look into, please comment on that as well. I could probably do some more research of my own but its exam period and I need to make this choice before the end of the semester, so I apologize if it feels like I'm leeching too much.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS THREAD IS NOT TO CONVINCE ME OF STAYING IN SCHOOL. You have no right to judge me because you know nothing about what I've considered. It is unfair to criticize someone's judgement that they took many hours considering on whim. Please don't derail the thread.\n\nIf you intend to continue anyway, please understand that I CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL if I fail. It's only a year or two of my life. My financial issues aren't so bad that these two years would cost my life. Although I'm doing decently in this program (low 80 average ish), I've decided that before starting the 2nd half of 2nd year, to go on \"leave\" and start playing DotA seriously. Basically I can come back to school if I fail miserably. To make money I plan on streaming (10-13 hours a day every day), coaching (not sure how this works), and winning tournaments. If I end up failing miserably in gaming I can go back to school.HERE ARE MY CONC", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_438", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " and kick-starting the company’s push toward product prominence in the 2000s.\n\n4) Independence Day (1996). Just months after Tom Cruise saved the United States from a potential international conflict, an intergalactic struggle was narrowly avoided thanks to the inspiration of President Bill Pullman (God bless ‘im), and the quick-thinking of Jeff Goldblum, whose Apple Macintosh PowerBook 5300 was able to upload a virus directly into the mothership’s operating system.\n\nNow how, you might ask, would a piece of Apple technology (advanced though it may be) be able to take down an alien civilization with thousands, perhaps millions, of years worth of technological innovation? This has been a topic for discussion for nearly two decades now, but as it turns out, the plot point isn’t so far-fetched within the context of the film. According to scientists in the flick, the 1947 Roswell Incident recovered an alien vessel whose technology was studied at Area 51 for some five decades, with many of its advances incorporated into the latest and greatest innovations in global computing.\n\n(If that’s not enough to convince you of the logic, other people have given it more thought than we have. A lot more thought.)\n\nOnce again, Apple comes out looking like the technology of the future, which in the right hands can outsmart space aliens whose ships travel at light-speed.\n\n5) You’ve Got Mail (1998). This sweet romantic comedy drew a distinct parallel between dying industries and the trends that threatened to put them out of business. Ironically, the business in question was a mom-and-pop bookstore which faced an uphill battle against a huge conglomerate. Fast-forward to today when even the conglomerates are struggling against digital book sales for tablet devices, the most popular of which is – gasp! – the iPad. In any event, watch the trailer and count the times you see that sexy Apple laptop:\n\nWhile corporate curmudgeon Tom Hanks favors the uptight businessman’s IBM desktop, free-spirited and independent Meg Ryan prefers her sleek PowerBook 3400. Whenever it came to the heroine of the movie tapping out an email, Apple dominated the screen.\n\nYet again, while other companies ostensibly paid for placement, again, Apple didn’t.\n\n6) Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002). With the inclusion in this third installment of the highly popular film series, Apple’s 21st century push for product prominence was in full swing by 2002. This time it was the PowerBook G4 that was featured, once again implying that when it comes to spies and espionage, the power of an Apple can’t be matched. (Interesting how easily a spy from the ’60s and a foxy glamour girl from the ’70s can use such an incredible piece of technology, perhaps a nod to Apple’s imminently user-friendly interface. Even your totally groovy granddad will love it, baby.)\n\n7) The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). When you want to sell your stuff on eBay, it turns out that an all-in-one iMac was your best bet back in 2005. The 27 featured products and nearly 60 appearances only netted Apple 2% of all product placements and 37 seconds of screen time. However, look for its appearance in this memorable scene where a confidence-lacking Steve Carell attempts to make conversation with a customer who slipped him her phone number.\n\n(Earmuffs for the kids, please; this one’s got a foul language alert.)\n\n8) “The Office” and others (2006). A Washington Post article from 2006 described how Apple products seemed to be dominating the small screen, particularly on network television’s most popular shows: “CSI: NY,” on CBS Fox’s (recently resurrected) “24” and “Las Vegas,” which appeared on NBC. However, the focus of the article was on a particular scene in a beloved show that just wrapped this past year. You know the one.\n\n“The Office” was one of television’s most popular programs in 2006, and one episode prominently featured bumbling boss Michael Scott (Steve Carell, by now of 40-Year-Old Virgin fame) giving one of his employees a gift that would turn the rest of the office green with envy. That gift happened to be an iPod. If you remember the episode, the scheme worked.\n\n9) Sex and the City (2008). While this show is known for its use of Apple products throughout its run (check out the upside-down logo in season 6, a confusing reversal of Jobs’ positioning policy), the first spin-off flick gave Apple products more than ten minutes of screen time – of the dozens of products and appearances in the film, Apple scored 13%", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

One of the oldest authoritative interpretations of the Bible understands the prohibition over the wearing of a man’s clothes by a woman as an injunction against women bearing arms.

(Audio) Jews for Guns Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. “Founded by Jews in 1989, JPFO initially aimed at educating the Jewish community about the historical evils that Jews have suffered when they have been disarmed.” “Founded by Jews in 1989, JPFO initially aimed at educating the Jewish community about the historical evils that Jews have suffered when they have been disarmed.”\n\nThe Reform movement’s Religious Action Center has decried the recent shootings and called for “common-sense gun control laws.” A blog on the Center’s website clarifies what the RAC thinks this means. “The most effective way to prevent gun deaths,” it says, “is to reduce the number of guns.” An earlier editorial by a RAC associate director went further. It decried the prospect of an armed and balkanized American society—and derided the argument that “only when Jews have guns have they been able to preserve Jewish honor and dignity.” The RAC’s answer to threats that Jews might face is tikkun olam.\n\nThe president of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly made a more interesting comment on the shootings. He condemned them, but also noted “the fragility of the fundamental social contract that binds us to each other in a civil society. Each and every assault on that unwritten contract,” he observed, “erodes our sense of security, and in so doing, threatens to make us that much less trusting, and less compassionate.” This is undoubtedly true—and unhelpfully abstract. It begs the question of whether it is the guns or the shooters that pose the real problem.\n\nThe Orthodox Union condemned the shootings at the Sikh temple in Wisconsin as an assault on religious freedom—but did not mention guns. While Orthodox rabbis, like rabbis of other denominations, have undoubtedly sermonized on guns and violence, taking various positions, Orthodoxy’s Rabbinical Council of America issued no public statement about the recent events.\n\nJewish exegesis related to guns is necessarily indirect. Biblical and talmudic texts generally require people to secure possessions of theirs, such as dangerous dogs, that pose safety hazards. There are prohibitions on selling weapons to idol worshippers and criminals, lest the weapons be turned against Jews. At the same time, there are complicating biblical and talmudic pronouncements about moral freedom and pikuah nefesh, saving a life. In one talmudic commentary on Deuteronomy, the prohibition on a woman’s wearing men’s clothing includes a ban on her wearing weapons, the quintessential male accoutrement. It follows that for men, wearing weapons is natural.\n\nBut none of these sources figures in American Jews’ discussions of guns; instead, there is near blanket opposition. Why?\n\nAt the center of the gun issue is power: To whom does the positive and negative power of weapons rightfully belong? Max Weber famously defined the state as an entity with a monopoly on violence; and the American Jewish attitude towards guns, following Weber, cedes all responsibility for the protection of individuals—of Jews—to government. American Jews, as opposed to Jews through most of history, unilaterally cede this power even though it is available to them.\n\nThe issue is not simply Left versus Right. The Reform movement explicitly wishes to restrict or prohibit individual gun ownership. In contrast, Orthodox silence on the issue tacitly accepts both the legal status quo, which permits private guns, and social norms, under which Jews do not own guns. The denominational positions effectively converge. Guns are not for Jews.\n\nOne pathological consequence of Jewish powerlessness has been the tendency to embrace weakness, rationalizing it and the suffering it produces as elevated and noble. Another pathology is guilt regarding whatever power one does possess.

{"id": "sample_6_445", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " or alcohol abuse problem running alongside their mental illness and a recent US study found that around 26% of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia use street drugs.6 In addition there is considerable debate at the moment around the issue of whether street drug use in the early years can actually cause schizophrenia to develop later on.\n\nBelow we consider some of these issues and ask whether street drug use has any place in recovery from schizophrenia.\n\nStreet Drug Use and Psychotic Symptoms\n\nA number of drugs used illicitly for recreational purposes do cause symptoms similar to those experienced in psychosis. For instance cocaine and methamphetamine can both cause paranoia and amphetamine and LSD can cause visual hallucinations. Cannabis can cause both auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoia. It is thought that this is caused by the primary active constituent of cannabis; a chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.11\n\nAlthough there have been attempts made by researchers to differentiate between the psychotic symptoms caused by street drugs and the symptoms of the schizophrenia itself they have had mixed results. It is in practice very difficult to say which symptoms are caused by the illness and which by the drugs.9 However in these cases, if the drug alone is to blame, then these symptoms will usually pass off when the drug use stops\n\nCannabis and Schizophrenia\n\nAt the time of writing (December 2015) this is probably one of the most hotly debated subjects in the mental health field. It is true to say that the spotlight has very much fallen on cannabis use as a cause of schizophrenia and much research work is currently being carried out. It has been suggested that cannabis use in early life (young teen age) increases the likelihood of the person going on to develop schizophrenia later. It has also been suggested that with the newer forms of stronger cannabis that have become available in recent years this risk has increased.\n\nWhilst the proponents of legalisation of cannabis argue that cannabis has few adverse health effects when compared to alcohol or tobacco use, there is a developing weight of scientific research that suggests that there is a link between cannabis use and schizophrenia. Although it would be true to say that at this stage the evidence is not yet conclusive, the accumulating weight of evidence does currently implicate cannabis as a cause of schizophrenia.\n\nThere have now been a number of authoritative studies that have shown a link between cannabis use in adolescence and the onset of schizophrenia later, for instance the recent South London study1 by Sir Robin Murray and colleagues from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College, London which looked at over 400 people with schizophrenia and found that use of Skunk (a type of cannabis produced from genetically modified plants) increased the risk of developing psychotic illness threefold. This more or less confirmed the findings of previous work done in the UK and overseas and was very close to the 2.4 times increased risk reported in one of the earliest studies carried out on this subject which looked at over 45,000 soldiers in Sweden.2 It also supported the findings of a three year study of over 4,800 people carried out in the Netherlands.\n\nHowever these studies do not answer all the questions. For instance, is it the case that the people most likely to resort to cannabis in adolescence are also those most prone to developing schizophrenia later? That is young people who have already started to develop the prodromal symptoms. But here again there is a weight of research evidence that suggests that cannabis use will lead to schizophrenia even in those who have not yet developed any prodromal symptoms (symptoms that can appear in the very earliest stages of the illness)3.\n\nIt is still the case though that the mechanism by which cannabis acts on the brain to produce this higher risk is still not fully understood and some researchers have suggested that rather than causing an increase in the risk in the general population the risk is limited to that group in the population who already have a genetic risk of developing the illness. That is to say that if you already have a genetic predisposition to the illness, cannabis use will act as a trigger. This has implications for people who have family members who have already been diagnosed with schizophrenia and serve as a warning to stay away from street drugs and ensure that their children do the same.10 There may be something in this since, as critics of this research are quick to point out, the epidemiology does not confirm the research work in as much as the incidence of schizophrenia in the general population has remained fairly constant over the past 50 years whilst the use of cannabis has increased during that time.\n\nThere have also been studies that have connected the amount of cannabis consumed with the likelihood of developing schizophrenia and have found that the more you use cannabis the higher the risk of developing schizophrenia4.\n\nIt is also likely that people who continue to use cannabis after the onset of schizophrenia will experience a worsened outcome, having more severe negative and depressive symptoms5 This runs counter to the belief that many people working in mental health in the UK particularly those working in third sector organisations hold that people with schizophrenia use cannabis to “self medicate�", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

That's just me tho. When I have a serious problem like that my first instinct is to get help because I know I can't do it on my own\"\n\nLater that day, however, Carter and Roy discuss the best way for him to produce carbon monoxide (CO).\n\nCarter: \"Well there's more ways to make CO. Google ways to make it. . . \"\n\nRoy: \"Omg\"\n\nCarter: \"What\"\n\nRoy: \"portable generator that's it\"\n\nJuly 8, 2014\n\nThe next day Roy seems less resolute.\n\nCarter: \"So are you sure you don't wanna [kill yourself] tonight?\"\n\nRoy: \"What do you mean am I sure?\"\n\nCarter: \"Like, are you definitely not doing it tonight?\"\n\nRoy: \"Idk yet I'll let you know\"\n\nCarter: \"Because I'll stay up with you if you wanna do\n\nit tonight\"\n\nRoy: \" Another day wouldn't hurt\"\n\nCarter: \"You can't keep pushing it off, tho, that's all you keep doing\"\n\nJuly 11, 2014\n\nOn this day Carter sends Roy her opinion about using a generator in the truck, as opposed to a water pump.\n\nCarter: \"...Well in my opinion, I think u should do the generator because I don't know much\n\nabout the pump and with a generator u can't fail\"\n\nJuly 4-12, 2014\n\nThis series of messages was sent over a span of nine days.

I want my family to know there was nothing they could do. I am entrapped in my own thoughts\"\n\nRoy: \"like no I would be happy if they had no guilt about it. because I have a bad feeling tht this is going to create a lot of depression between my parents/sisters\"\n\nRoy: \"i'm overthinking everything. . f**k. I gotta stop and just do it\"\n\nCarter: \"I think your parents know you're in a really bad place. Im not saying they want you to do it, but I honestly feel like they can accept it. They know there's nothing they can do, they've tried helping, everyone's tried. But there's a point that comes where there isn't anything anyone can do to save you, not even yourself, and you've hit that point and I think your parents know you've hit that point. You said you're mom saw a suicide thing on your computer and she didn't say anything. I think she knows it's on your mind and she's prepared for it\"\n\nCarter: Everyone will be sad for a while, but they will get over it and move on. They won't be in depression I won't let that happen. They know how sad you are and they know that you're doing this to be happy, and I think they will understand and accept it.

{"id": "sample_6_453", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " month. He made an FDR-like national speech that attempted to whip up a public frenzy. He promised that if the legislature passed his law, supply and demand for workers would magically come together. We only need to agree to spend a few hundred billion more!\n\nWell, the bully pulpit has become the bull-something pulpit. It seems that hardly anyone even took the speech seriously as a political point. It was reviewed and treated as the theater that it was, but the universal reaction to the specifics was a thumbs down, even from his own party.\n\nNo, Obama is not FDR. This is not the New Deal. The public will not be browbeaten as it once was. The polls show a vast lack of even a modicum of confidence in political leadership, the failures of which are all around us.\n\nThe longer the depression persists, the more the rebellious spirit grows, and it is not limited to the Wall Street protests. Poverty is growing, incomes are falling, business is being squeezed at every turn, and unemployment is stuck at intolerably high levels. People are angry as never before, and neither political party comes close to offering answers.\n\nThe State as we've known it — and that includes its political parties and its redistributionary, military, regulatory, and money-creating bureaucracies — just can't get it together. It's as true now as it has been for some twenty years: the Nation State is in precipitous decline. Once imbued with grandeur and majesty, personified by its Superman powers to accomplish amazing global feats, it is now a wreck and out of ideas.\n\nIt doesn't seem that way because the State is more in-your-face than it has been in all of American history. We see the State at the airport with the incompetent bullying ways of the TSA. We see it in the ridiculous dinosaur of the post office, forever begging for more money so it can continue to do things the way it did them in 1950. We see it in the federalized cops in our towns, once seen as public servants but now revealed as what they have always been: armed tax collectors, censors, spies, thugs.\n\nThese are themselves marks of decline. The mask of the State is off. And it has been off for such a long time that we can hardly remember what it looked like when it was on.\n\nSo let's take a quick tour. If you live in a big metropolitan city, drive to the downtown post office (if it is still standing). There you will find a remarkable piece of architecture, tall and majestic and filled with grandeur. There is a liberal use of Roman-style columns. The ceilings indoors are extremely high and thrilling. It might even be the biggest and most impressive building around.\n\nThis is a building of an institution that believed in itself. After all, this was the institution that carried the mail, which was the only way that people had to communicate with each other when most of these places were first erected. The state took great pride in offering this service, which it held up as being superior to anything the market could ever provide (even if market provisions like the Pony Express had to be outlawed). Postmen were legendary (or so we were told) for their willingness to brave the elements to bring us the essential thing we needed in life apart from food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nAnd today? Look at the thing that we call the post office. It is a complete wreck, a national joke, a hanger-on from a day long gone. They deliver physical spam to our mail boxes, and a few worthwhile things every once in a while, but the only time they are in the news is when we hear another report of their bankruptcy and need for a bailout.\n\nIt's the same with all the grand monuments of yesteryear's statism. Think of the Hoover Dam, Mount Rushmore, the endless infrastructure projects of the New Deal, the Eisenhower interstate highway system, the moon shot, the sprawling monuments to itself that the State has erected from sea to shining sea. As I've explained elsewhere, these all came about in an age when the only real alternative to socialism was considered to be fascism. This was an age when freedom — as in the old-fashioned sense — was just out of the question.\n\nThe State in all times and all places operates by force — and force alone. But the style of rule changes. The fascist style emphasized inspiration, magnificence, industrial progress, grandeur, all headed by a valiant leader making smart decisions about all things. This style of American rule lasted from the New Deal through the end of the Cold War.\n\nBut this whole system of inspiration has nearly died out. In the communist tradition of naming the stages of history, we can call this late fascism. The fascist system in the end cannot work because, despite the claims, the State does not have the means to achieve what it promises. It does not possess the capability to out", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_6_455", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "So now we move on to installing the flight controller onto the frame. Now, all flight controllers have an orientation and so it is important that you secure it to your frame facing the correct way (this saves a lot of a hassle later). Specifically for the Flip32+ board that we used here, the USB port is the back of the board and the opposite side is subsequently the forward facing side. You therefore have to place the flight controller so that the forward facing side is pointing in the same direction as the front of the quadcopter (for the Silver Blade #37 there is no specific 'front' so you can choose).\n\nWe secured the Flip32+ here with 3M mounting foam to the middle of the quadcopter (facing the correct way) and then we proceeded to plugging in the ESCs. We use the servo cables to plug the ESCs in (the black, red and white cable) and these plug into the output pins of the flight controller. This is because the flight controller outputs information to the ESCs to control the speed of the motor. According to which flight controller you're using, each motor is numbered 1 to 4 in a specific order (as mentioned above). You need to plug the ESC connected to motor 1 into the output pin labeled 1 on the flight controller, the ESC connected to motor 2 into the pin labeled 2 etc. You also need to plug the servo cables into the pins in the correct orientation. The three coloured wires in the cable (black, red and white) correspond to ground, voltage and signal wires respectively. You therefore need to ensure that the ground wires are connected to the ground pins, the voltage wires are connected to the voltage pins and the signal wires are connected to the signal pins. You can see this demonstrated in the pictures above. Most flight controllers will have the pins labeled with which pin is ground, which pin is voltage and which pin is signal. For example, in our Flip32+ guide, you can see that the pins are labeled with G, V and 6 (the 6 is for motor 6 but this is the signal pin).So now we move on to installing the flight controller onto the frame. Now, all flight controllers have an orientation and so it is important that you secure it to your frame facing the correct way (this saves a lot of a hassle later). Specifically for the Flip32+ board that we used here, the USB port is the back of the board and the opposite side is subsequently the forward facing side. You therefore have to place the flight controller so that the forward facing side is pointing in the same direction as the front of the quadcopter (for the Silver Blade #37 there is no specific 'front' so you can choose).\n\nWe secured the Flip32+ here with 3M mounting foam to the middle of the quadcopter (facing the correct way) and then we proceeded to plugging in the ESCs. We use the servo cables to plug the ESCs in (the black, red and white cable) and these plug into the output pins of the flight controller.

{"id": "sample_6_457", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " Montreal Wanderers, had it out for each other — each man threatened to buy the other out, and the two even came close to blows on several occasions. When Livingstone, who already owned a team called the Shamrocks, bought another club, called the Blueshirts, the league quickly enacted a new rule, prohibiting any person from owning more than one franchise. Livingstone complained constantly about irregularities he perceived on and off the ice — from questionable refereeing to questionable business practices by the other owners — leading the league to devise ways of getting rid of him.\n\nThings came to a head in early 1917. To help the military recruit more fans, the NHA admitted a team representing the Canadian Expeditionary Force’s 228th Battalion for the 1916-17 season. Livingstone disputed their claims to two of his Toronto Blueshirts players who’d enlisted in the military; as a result, the 228th to threaten to pull out of the league if Livingstone continued to play them.\n\nWhen the 228th Battalion withdrew from the NHA in February 1917, having been called up to fight in Europe, the other owners saw their chance. The league held a meeting three days later. Livingstone declined to attend, due to illness; instead, he sent a private telegram to league president Frank Robinson indicating that he supported a five-team circuit for the rest of the season. The other owners, whose teams, like Livingstone’s, had been decimated by the First World War, wanted to divide the Blueshirts among themselves to replenish their own teams’ lineups and run with just four teams. And so it went: Toronto was suspended for the rest of the season, and Livingstone was not compensated for the cancelled Blueshirts games or for the players he was compelled to loan out.\n\nLivingstone launched a series of lawsuits against the NHA and its teams. The writs he served in person during the league finals in Ottawa weren’t taken seriously — the Ottawa Senators (no relation to the current franchise) left them in their locker room for an entire weekend.\n\nAs the 1917-18 season loomed, the NHA considered dealing with the Livingstone problem by simply forming a new league without the cantankerous owner. After a series of meetings, the National Hockey League was officially established on November 26, 1917. Apart from the name change and lack of Livingstone, little distinguished the NHL from the NHA. “Livingstone was always arguing,” observed Senators part-owner Tommy Gorman. “Let’s make money instead.”\n\nThe announcement was delayed by dithering over the future of the Quebec Bulldogs, who decided to sit out the season (they returned in 1919, played one lousy season, then moved to Hamilton). The Bulldogs were replaced by a temporary Toronto franchise, the Toronto Hockey Club, which would play until the legal issues with Livingstone were resolved. The new team, operated by the owners of the Arena Gardens rink, leased its players from Livingstone and agreed not to release, sell, or trade any of them without his consent. It lacked an official nickname, which has caused confusion over the years — the press called them the Blueshirts, while the league retroactively called them the Arenas when it updated the Stanley Cup in the late 1940s.\n\nRelated:\n\nSeveral mishaps befell the league over the first few weeks of its existence. The financially shaky Wanderers demanded the rights to all the Bulldogs’ players, then demanded other teams loan them skaters, then threatened to drop out. In Toronto, the man initially hired to manage the team dropped out due to illness and was replaced by Toronto Daily News columnist and Arena Gardens hockey booker Charlie Querrie. A week before the season began, the Toronto Daily Star printed a list of 15 tips from Querrie to his players, including this gem: “Don’t knock your fellow players. Remember they might also have a hammer concealed somewhere and might be tempted to use it.”\n\nThe first game on December 19 saw Toronto play the Wanderers at Montreal’s Westmount Arena. Only 700 people showed up, despite an effort by Wanderer management to offer free tickets to wounded soldiers (who, to qualify, had to have been injured in battle, and had to be accompanied by an officer). Wanderer Dave Ritchie scored the NHL’s first goal. The Toronto Daily Star felt he was the star of the evening, “tearing loose with sparkling runs galore.” Ritchie’s teammate Harry Hyland scored five goals, while Toronto’s Reg Noble scored four. The game was a nail-biter — the score was tied several times — but the Wanderers pulled out a 10-9 victory. The Montreal Gazette felt the game reflected “the scarcity of players, as men who would not have been used as substitutes a year ago were on the benches of both teams", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_6_458", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "The DZero collaboration at Fermilab on Thursday announced the discovery of a new particle whose quark content appears to be qualitatively different from normal.\n\nAn ordinary meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark, whereas an ordinary baryon is made from three quarks. Physicists have long conjectured that exotic particles containing an additional quark-antiquark pair could exist, and a handful of candidates have been seen. Such particles, called tetraquarks, or their close relatives, the pentaquarks, would be exotic states forming a new particle species paralleling the ordinary mesons and baryons.\n\nDZero searched for new exotic states decaying into a B s meson and a pi meson. Both of these are well-known mesons, which travel finite distances before decaying via the weak nuclear interaction. The B s meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark of bottom and strange types, and the pi meson has an up and down quark and antiquark.\n\nThe study, using the full data set acquired at the Tevatron collider from 2002 to 2011 totaling 10 inverse femtobarns, identified the B s meson through its decay into intermediate J/psi and phi mesons, which subsequently decayed into a pair of oppositely charged muons and a pair of oppositely charged K mesons respectively (see diagram).\n\nThe plot of the mass distribution of the B s and pi meson combination (see the mass plot) shows an excess of 133 ± 31 events over the estimated background, with a mass of 5,568 MeV. The mass peak of the new state, called X(5568), is relatively broad (22 MeV) indicating that the particle decays via the strong interaction. The probability that previously known processes could have fluctuated to give a signal as strong as that seen is only 1 in about 6 million (5.1 standard deviation significance), after taking into account the estimated uncertainties in the analysis and the possibility that such a fluctuation could have occurred anywhere within the search window.\n\nThe fact that the new X(5568) particle decays via the strong interaction into a B s and pi mesons tells us that it contains four distinct flavors of quarks and antiquarks – bottom, strange, up and down. Several other previously observed particles are good candidates to be tetraquark or pentaquark states, but all of these have a quark and antiquark of the same flavor, and thus their character as an exotic particle is less certain.\n\nThe detailed internal structure of the new X(5568) particle, or the other tetraquark candidates, is not yet understood; they could be a relatively tightly bound combination of all four quarks and antiquarks, or they could be a structures in which two tightly bound quark-antiquark states revolve around each other (see figure).\n\nMeasuring the properties of the new X(5568) particle and other tetraquark candidates – their masses, lifetimes, spins and parities, as well as the probabilities for them to decay into various final particle combinations – will give valuable new information about how the strong force binds quarks (and antiquarks) into observable particles.\n\nDmitri Denisov and Paul Grannis are the co-spokespersons for the DZero experiment.The DZero collaboration at Fermilab on Thursday announced the discovery of a new particle whose quark content appears to be qualitatively different from normal.\n\nAn ordinary meson is composed of a quark and an antiquark, whereas an ordinary baryon is made from three quarks.

{"id": "sample_6_468", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " Thyroid hormones are also required for growth and development in children. Thyroid disease, if left untreated, can lead to heart disease, infertility, muscle weakness, and osteoporosis.\n\n-- A 2010 study found that PFOA can damage your thyroid function. Individuals with the highest PFOA concentrations were more than twice as likely to report current thyroid disease, compared to those with the lowest PFOA concentrations. Your thyroid contains thyroglobulin protein, which binds to iodine to form hormones, which in turn influence essentially every organ, tissue and cell in your body. Thyroid hormones are also required for growth and development in children. Thyroid disease, if left untreated, can lead to heart disease, infertility, muscle weakness, and osteoporosis. Cancer -- PFOA has been associated with tumors in at least four different organs in animal tests (liver, pancreas, testicles and mammary glands in rats), and has been associated with increases in prostate cancer in PFOA plant workers.\n\n-- PFOA has been associated with tumors in at least four different organs in animal tests (liver, pancreas, testicles and mammary glands in rats), and has been associated with increases in prostate cancer in PFOA plant workers. Immune system problems -- Several studies by scientists in Sweden indicate that PFCs have an adverse effect on your immune system.

As described in a report on PFCs by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), PFOA was found to decrease all immune cell subpopulations studied, in the thymus and spleen, and caused immunosupression. Increased LDL cholesterol levels – A 2010 study in the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine 5 found that children and teens with higher PFOA levels had higher levels of total cholesterol and LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol, while PFOS was associated with increased total cholesterol, including both LDL cholesterol and HDL or \"good\" cholesterol.\n\nI strongly recommend avoiding any product you know containing these toxic compounds, particularly non-stick cookware, but also foods sold in grease-proof food packaging, such as fast food and microwave popcorn. Clearly, if you're eating fast food or junk food, PFCs from the wrapper may be the least of your problems, but I think it's still important to realize that not only are you not getting proper nutrition from the food itself, the wrappers may also add to your toxic burden.\n\n6. Non-Organic Potatoes and Other Fresh Produce Known for High Pesticide Contamination\n\nYour best bet is to buy only organic fruits and vegetables, as synthetic agricultural chemicals are not permissible under the USDA organic rules. That said, not all conventionally grown fruits and vegetables are subjected to the same amount of pesticide load. While Koch focuses on potatoes, as they tend to take up a lot of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals present in the soil, I would recommend reviewing the \"Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce\"6 by the Environmental Working Group.\n\nOf the 48 different fruit and vegetable categories tested by the EWG for the 2013 guide, the following 15 fruits and vegetables had the highest pesticide load, making them the most important to buy or grow organically:\n\nApples Celery Cherry tomatoes Cucumbers Grapes Hot peppers Nectarines (imported) Peaches Potatoes Spinach Strawberries Sweet bell peppers Kale Collard greens Summer squash\n\nIn contrast, the following foods were found to have the lowest residual pesticide load, making them the safest bet among conventionally grown vegetables. Note that a small amount of sweet corn and most Hawaiian papaya, although low in pesticides, are genetically engineered (GE). If you're unsure of whether the sweet corn or papaya is GE, I'd recommend opting for organic varieties:\n\nAsparagus Avocado Cabbage Cantaloupe Sweet corn (non-GMO) Eggplant Grapefruit Kiwifruit Mango Mushrooms Onions Papayas (non-GMO. Most Hawaiian papaya is GMO) Pineapple Sweet peas (frozen) Sweet potatoes\n\n7. Table Salt\n\nSalt is essential for life—you cannot live without it. However, regular 'table salt' and the salt found in processed foods are NOT identical to the salt your body really needs. In fact, table salt has practically nothing in common with natural salt. One is health damaging, and the other is healing.\n\nProcessed salt is 98 percent sodium chloride, and the remaining two percent comprises man-made chemicals, such as moisture absorbents, and a little added iodine.

{"id": "sample_6_473", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " below ground. Peatlands release carbon for decades after deforestation as the underlying peat decomposes or is burnt.\n\nIndonesia has by far the largest area of tropical peatland in the world: 22 million hectares. Sumatra, the Kalimantan provinces on the island of Borneo, and Papua have about a third each.\n\nGlobal significance of Indonesia’s peatlands\n\nIndonesia’s peatlands hold at least 57 billion tonnes (Gigatonnes or Gt) of carbon, making them a globally significant terrestrial carbon pool. The pool is comparable to the Amazonian rainforest, which holds about 86 billion tonnes.\n\nTo limit the world to 2 degrees of warming, we can emit no more than 600 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases between now and 2050. Indonesia’s peatland carbon alone, if released as CO 2 in the atmosphere, is equivalent to one-third of the remaining carbon budget.\n\nWhat then are the chances of Indonesia losing its entire peatland carbon stock?\n\nIndonesia’s peatland in a downward spiral\n\nIndonesia became a leading raw material supplier in the timber, paper and oil palm industries in the 1970s. Deforestation and degradation of Indonesia’s forests took place on an epic scale, and Indonesia lost more than half its peat forest cover. Just over 10 million hectares remained forested by 2010. Only Papua retained large areas of pristine peat swamp forest.\n\nThis downward spiral won’t end any time soon. Each year Sumatra loses another 5% of its lowland forests; the situation is similar in the Kalimantan provinces. In all this, Papua is the new frontier. With logging on the rise, pulp mills planned and large areas of land under concessions, it is poised to go the way of Sumatra and Kalimantan.\n\nThe extent of forest degradation is another sign of trouble ahead. Where peatland has been deforested, fragmented or drained, it is transformed from an unburnable resource into a tinder-box.\n\nA detailed study which analysed over 10 million hectares of peatland in Sumatra and Kalimantan found that most was degraded. Less than 4% was covered by pristine peatswamp forests and just 11% or 1 million hectares were covered by relatively intact forests. The remainder is on a trajectory of fire and conversion into plantations, as the recent events in Sumatra demonstrate.\n\nClimate change itself is working against peatlands. In what is termed a “positive feedback cycle”, climate change is expected to produce more prolonged El Niño dry periods in Indonesia, leading to more intense fires, which in turn cause further climate change. During the 2006 El Niño, there were 40,000 fire hotspots on Indonesia’s peatlands.\n\nThe peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan are headed for collapse. Major question marks surround Papua’s peatlands.\n\nWhat does it mean for Indonesia’s greenhouse emissions?\n\nThe peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan are no longer a carbon sink but a carbon source. With steadily increasing emissions from decomposition of peatland combined with large contributions from fires during El Niño years, peatland emissions are now in the order of 1 Gt of CO 2 a year on average and rising.\n\nIf Indonesia’s peatlands were a country, they would be the world’s 7th or 8th largest emitter. Over the coming decades, almost all of Sumatra and Kalimantan’s peatland carbon could be released.\n\nMore alarmingly, with half of Indonesia’s peatland deforested or degraded, around 100 Gt of CO 2 or about 150 times Australia’s annual emissions could be released into the atmosphere over the coming decades.\n\nWith this situation Indonesia has little hope of achieving its pledge to cut its emissions by 26% or 41% by 2020, which relies heavily on reducing forests and peatland emissions.\n\nWhat can be done about it?\n\nIndonesia has fought hard to address the problems of deforestation and peatland loss. It has launched major campaigns to stamp out illegal logging. It has established a Commission Against Corruption, whose clashes with the Indonesian Police are watched with fascination locally, and portrayed as the struggle of the plucky gecko versus the crocodile.\n\nIndonesia has attempted without much success to enforce the law banning plantations on deep peat, impose due process in issuing forest concessions, and prevent fires on peatland. It has implemented a moratorium against deforestation with the strong encouragement of Norway, established a national REDD agency (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), and issued regulations to protect remaining forests.\n\nBut in a country notorious for its entrenched political economy of korupsi", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

The error, he said, was made when the unidentified staffer read an email from the mayor’s office. The staffer, however, did not read which bill was vetoed by the mayor, according to Chambers.\n\n“Ryan, we have policies and procedures in place that were not followed,” he said. “She assumed it was the marijuana legislation. That was not the case.”\n\nThe mayor actually vetoed the sale of a portion of land to Hapeville, according to the council.\n\nCORRECTION: Mayor's veto was regarding the sale of a portion of land to Hapeville, GA — Atlanta City Council (@ATLCouncil) October 11, 2017\n\n“President Mitchell did not have anything to do with this,” said Chambers, who did not specify how the new staffer would be discplined.\n\nReed didn’t buy the explanation and said he questioned if Chambers should remain in his post as the head of communications.\n\n“This was intentional,” he said. “This was a political stunt. Y’all were trying to score political points. Go tell your folks you fell on the sword.”\n\nReed, who makes regular appearances on Cameron’s show, said he planned to tout the signing of the legislation and a related ceremony on Wednesday’s program — before the social media firestorm.\n\nHe said he signed the measure, which will reduce the penalty for possessing an ounce or less of pot in the city from $1,000 to $75 and eliminate jail time under those circumstances, at 6:24 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nAfter the show, he tweeted a picture of that moment.A new staffer faces disciplinary action after a tweet from the Atlanta City Council’s verified account created a political firestorm early Wednesday.\n\nThe erroneous tweet, which indicated Mayor Kasim Reed vetoed a measure intended to reduce penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana, was pushed out to thousands of the council’s followers just after 6 a.m. — nearly 12 hours after he signed the legislation.\n\nGood morning #Atlanta.

For devices to be useful, such control must be achieved at room temperature. The only single-phase multiferroic material exhibiting unambiguous magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature is BiFeO3 (refs 4 and 5). Its weak ferromagnetism arises from the canting of the antiferromagnetically aligned spins by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction6, 7, 8, 9. Prior theory considered the symmetry of the thermodynamic ground state and concluded that direct 180-degree switching of the DM vector by the ferroelectric polarization was forbidden10, 11. Instead, we examined the kinetics of the switching process, something not considered previously in theoretical work10, 11, 12. Here we show a deterministic reversal of the DM vector and canted moment using an electric field at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that the switching kinetics favours a two-step switching process. In each step the DM vector and polarization are coupled and 180-degree deterministic switching of magnetization hence becomes possible, in agreement with experimental observation. We exploit this switching to demonstrate energy-efficient control of a spin-valve device at room temperature. The energy per unit area required is approximately an order of magnitude less than that needed for spin-transfer torque switching13, 14. Given that the DM interaction is fundamental to single-phase multiferroics and magnetoelectrics3, 9, our results suggest ways to engineer magnetoelectric switching and tailor technologically pertinent functionality for nanometre-scale, low-energy-consumption, non-volatile magnetoelectronics.A team led by postdoctoral associate John Heron of Cornell University has developed a room-temperature magnetoelectric memory design that replaces power-hungry electric currents with an electric field.

A Ugandan doctor working in the country died this month.\n\nBrisbane, who once served as a medical adviser to the former Liberian president, Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia.\n\nAfter falling ill, he was taken to a treatment centre on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister.Under the supervision of health workers, family members escorted the doctor's body to a burial location west of the city, Nyenswah said.\n\nHe said another doctor who had been working in Liberia's central Bong County was being treated for Ebola at the centre where Brisbane died.\n\nThe situation \"is getting more and more scary,\" Nyenswah said.\n\nLast week Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor fell ill with the disease and in Liberia, Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, announced at the weekend that an American doctor was infected. Dr Kent Brantly had been isolated at the group's Ebola treatment centre at the ELWA hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.\n\nA second American, Nancy Writebol, later tested positive for the virus at the same medical compound, said Ken Isaacs, of Samaritan's Purse. Isaacs said Writebol, who works with the allied aid group SIM, was in a stable but serious condition at a hospital near Monrovia.\n\nBrantly received intensive treatment on Sunday and was talking to his medical team and working on his computer, said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for Samaritan's Purse.\n\n\"We are hopeful, but he is certainly not out of the woods yet,\" Strickland said.\n\nIn Nigeria, officials announced on Friday that a Liberian official had died of Ebola after flying from Monrovia to Lagos raising fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa. The WHO says the outbreak has also killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone.\n\nLiberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, used her Independence Day address to discuss a new taskforce to combat Ebola. Information minister, Lewis Brown, said: \"It will go from community to community, from village to village, from town to town in order to increase awareness.\"\n\nThere is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever and sore throat but then escalates to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.\n\nExperts believe the west African outbreak could have begun in January in south-east Guinea, though the first cases were not confirmed until March.\n\nSince then, officials have tried to contain the disease by isolating victims and educating populations on how to avoid transmission, though porous borders, satellite outbreaks and widespread distrust of health workers have made the outbreak difficult to bring under control.Dr Samuel Brisbane becomes first doctor in west African nation to die, as second US healthcare worker is infected\n\nOne of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, a government official said on Sunday, and a second US healthcare worker has been infected in what the World Health Organisation (WHO) is calling the largest outbreak ever recorded of the disease.\n\nDr Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak, which the WHO says has killed 129 people in the west African nation.

{"id": "sample_6_490", "config_id": 6, "prompt": " the exact opposite: I thought that they were just having a fluke week on super week and that their games vs Roccat and Millenium would boost them back up. Instead, they went 0-2 and look extremely vulnerable for the first time this season. It seemed expected that Dig would at least have close games with LMQ and CLG, but they were crushed in both games and garnered less than half of what was expected of them. Roccat went 2-0 against SK and Alliance. CLG went 2-0 against TSM and Dig in crushing victories. Gambit swapped their roster around and not even NiQ could post a decent score this week. SK did much worse than expected this week, however, they were expected to do the worst, or the 2nd worst in each of their respective positions, so I would say that was still accurate.\n\nOverall, my data predictions were extremely accurate and fairly precise last week. I was 0.56% accurate, and +/- 9.53 points precise for both EU and NA last week. A lot of that deviation comes from EU where teams like Gambit, SK, and Roccat scored upwards of 30 points off from the predicted values. In fact, EU was +/- 11.51 points precise while NA was +/- 7.54 points precise. The good thing about EU is that it remains extremely accurate due to many games being stomps. When one team in EU scores over, another team will score just as much under the projection.\n\nI found that another good way to compare how well predictions worked is to rank all players based on their predictions, and then see where they ended up for their actual performance. For last week, the two tables are here:\n\nProjected Week 8\n\nActual Week 8\n\nAs you can see, even though teams like SK did much worse than predicted, they were still predicted to be some of the worst players going into week 8, and they ended in relatively the same spots.\n\nWeek 9 Method\n\nNot many changes this week. The biggest change is that I am including the chart that ranks the players by their position which can be found directly below.\n\nAnd the points projected for each player (M3):\n\nTop Lane\n\nFNC SOAZ 42.61 points\n\nFnatic is now #1 in EU by elo, and they have crushed their competition in recent weeks. They also play the two weakest teams in EU this week: Gambit and CW. I’m going to spoil the rest of this for you, Fnatic is #1 in every position, and they will all have the same reasoning as s0AZ. Start them.\n\nTSM Dyrus 33.67 points\n\nTSM is a strong team that struggles to consistently beat the top teams in NA. This week, they play LMQ and coL. That seems a little contradictory for them to do well this week, but TSM players average 14 points a game against LMQ even though they have not beaten LMQ. They also average 25 points against coL. So expect TSM to do well this week. Dyrus is the biggest risk of the entire TSM roster because he only averages 6.5 points a game against LMQ and about 18.5 points a game against coL.\n\nLMQ Ackerman 31.15 points\n\nAckerman has been one of the best top laners throughout the split and he is lucky enough to be playing against TSM and CLG this week. Most teams score a lot of points for their top laners against CLG, and LMQ has yet to lose to TSM this split. If Ackerman performs to his average against these teams, he is in line to get 51 points, 31 from TSM and 20 from CLG. I would definitely start Ackerman.\n\nJungle\n\nFNC Cyanide 40.78 points\n\nFnatic player. See Soaz. See the past two weeks.\n\nTSM Amazing 39.47 points\n\nTSM plays coL and LMQ this week and both teams like to have games that either last extremely long or have a lot of kills. Amazing has 36 points on average from these teams, and his aggressive playstyle will be rewarded in these probably high-scoring games.\n\nMil KottenX 32.52 points\n\nKottenX always plays well. He has had maybe one bad week this split, but he has consistently been one of the top performers on a team that goes for kills. Mil plays a struggling SK and a resurgent Roccat this week, so they might have issues, but I thought they would have issues last week and almost all of them were #1 in their respective positions.\n\nMid\n\nFNC xPeke 48.48 points\n\nI tried warning you guys. Fnatic is #1 in every position, and I think those predictions are fair.

{"id": "sample_6_494", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "Michelle enjoys her first Deathgasm.\n\nIf there is one thing that New Zealand does right (other than Lord of the Rings and Flight of the Conchords) it's hilarious and gory horror flicks. Deathgasm follows in the footsteps of such films as Dead Alive,The Frighteners and Black Sheep as it continues the tradition of 'effed up yet funny as hell splatterfests. Jason Lei Howden makes his directorial debut with Deathgasm and it was an audience favorite at Austin's South by Southwest film festival.\n\n\"Sweet Force lightning, bro.\"\n\nThe film follows the adventures of a couple of high school metal heads who are trying to start a death metal band. They inadvertently summon demons (pretty damn brutal, I would say) and have to figure out a way to stop the monsters before they destroy the small town they reside in.

If you are a fan of heavy metal you will definitely enjoy the tune-age in this film.\n\n\"This ice cream tastes like death.\"\n\nNow here comes the best part of Deathgasm: lots and lots of blood and guts! Once the demons are unleashed, all hell breaks loose...literally! Demons vomit blood all over their victims, gouge out eyeballs, tear out intestines and all sorts of other ghastly things. It's awesome! Almost all of it is done with practical effects and props too--this is seriously some outstanding work in this movie. The term \"splatstick\" has been coined to describe the type of disturbing and funny mayhem that New Zealand horror films are famous for. Gorehounds will be incredibly pleased with the gore in this movie.\n\nWhat stands out the most to me about this film is the obvious love that went into making it. The director has stated that he was an outcast metal head growing up, so that experience influenced the direction he took\n\n. It harkens back to '80s horror films that didn't take themselves so seriously and weren't afraid to throw in a joke every once in awhile. I predict that this film will become a cult classic in a decade or so.\n\nScore\n\n-Michelle Kisner\n\nLike horror?

Deathgasm follows in the footsteps of such films as Dead Alive,The Frighteners and Black Sheep as it continues the tradition of 'effed up yet funny as hell splatterfests.

{"id": "sample_6_497", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "An Oklahoma high-school teacher charged with raping her 17-year-student is getting no jail time, leaving the parents of her victim stunned and outraged.\n\nErin Kathleen Queen of Sand Springs, Okla., was arrested March 17, 2012, after she was found at the Candlewood Suites hotel in Tulsa with the teen son of Shasta and Adam Belty. Queen was a 27-year-old English teacher at Charles Page High School at the time.\n\nAlthough Queen was originally charged with second-degree rape and contributing to the delinquency of a minor for supplying the boy with vodka, the case was dismissed this month when Queen pleaded guilty to a different felony count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nShe received three years of probation, was fined $600 and ordered to surrender her teacher’s license.\n\nRead the WND story that started it all! The big list: Female teachers with students\n\nAccording to Title 21, Section 1115 of the Oklahoma Statutes, sex may be considered rape if “… the victim is at least sixteen (16) years of age and is less than eighteen (18) years of age and is a student, or under the legal custody or supervision of any public or private elementary or secondary school, junior high or high school, or public vocational school, and engages in sexual intercourse with a person who is eighteen (18) years of age or older and is an employee of the same school system.”\n\nOn March 21, Tulsa County District Judge William Kellough gave Queen a three-year suspended sentence with no prison time and no community service hours.\n\nThe outcome has the teen’s parents livid.\n\n“I think it’s crap,” Adam Belty told the Tulsa World. “Should it be rape? No. Should she be charged with a sexual count for something? Yes, but the way (it) was explained, there’s no count (less than) second-degree rape that they can charge her with.”\n\n“It’s very frustrating to us that she basically got a slap on the wrist,” said the boy’s mother, Shasta Belty.\n\n“I cussed. I cried. I totally disagreed with it. (Assistant District Attorney Amanda Self) was under the impression that we were OK with a conviction as long as (Queen) never taught again. Well, we were OK with a conviction of the second-degree rape … or something that represents the sexual misconduct.”\n\nThe paper reports: “Within hours of Queen’s arrest, it seemed to the Beltys that the whole town of Sand Springs knew what had happened. Their son’s social circle grew smaller as friends and potential prom dates were prohibited from socializing with him. And as the lengthy legal process wore on, the options for his freshman year of college were limited by proximity so he could comply with subpoenas for his testimony.”\n\nShasta Belty says her son’s senior year was completely tainted.\n\n“People look at this as, ‘I don’t know why he’s complaining,’ you know? They haven’t been in our shoes. … They know nothing about it,” she said.\n\nMrs. Belty told KTUL-TV she learned of the sexual relationship with a phone call to her son.\n\n“He was reluctant to tell me but then he told me he was with Ms. Queen, Erin Queen. And I thought that name sounds familiar. And he said, ‘Mom, it’s my 5th-hour English teacher.’ And I died as a parent,” she told the station.\n\nThe Tulsa World reports the Beltys don’t believe current law in Oklahoma properly addresses offenses by female teachers, and “they think the legal system hesitates to call a consensual relationship between a student and teacher – especially a student and a female teacher – rape.”\n\n“If they’re not going to punish this law to the fullest extent of it, then there should be (a law against) sexual misconduct with students,” Shasta Belty said. “There should be something.”\n\nThe district attorney’s office disagrees with the Beltys, claiming justice has been served.\n\n“We believe a felony conviction holds this teacher accountable under the circumstances of this case,” the office said. “After speaking to the victim and the family, our office decided this was in the best interests of justice.”An Oklahoma high-school teacher charged with raping her 17-year-student is getting no jail time, leaving the parents of her victim stunned and outraged.\n\nErin Kathleen Queen of Sand Springs, Okla., was arrested March 17, 2012", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_6_498", "config_id": 6, "prompt": "Starting today, it appears the US military will be testing a device or devices that will potentially jam GPS signals for six hours each day. We say “appears” because officially the tests were announced by the FAA but are centered near the US Navy’s largest installation in the Mojave Desert. And the Navy won’t tell us much about what’s going on.\n\nThe FAA issued an advisory warning pilots on Saturday that global positioning systems (GPS) could be unreliable during six different days this month, primarily in the Southwestern United States. On June 7, 9, 21, 23, 28, and 30th the GPS interference testing will be taking place between 9:30am and 3:30pm Pacific time. But if you’re on the ground, you probably won’t notice interference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe testing will be centered on China Lake, California—home to the Navy’s 1.1 million acre Naval Air Weapons Center in the Mojave Desert. The potentially lost signals will stretch hundreds of miles in each direction and will affect various types of GPS, reaching the furthest at higher altitudes. But the jamming will only affect aircraft above 50 feet. As you can see from the FAA map below, the jamming will almost reach the California-Oregon border at 4o,000 feet above sea level and 505 nautical miles at its greatest range.\n\nI gave the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division a call yesterday, but they couldn’t tell me much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’re aware of the flight advisory,” Deidre Patin, Public Affairs specialist for Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division told me over the phone. But she couldn’t give me any details about whether there was indeed GPS “jamming,” nor whether it had happened before. Patin added, “I can’t go into the details of the testing, it’s general testing for our ranges.”\n\nAs AVWeb points out, Embraer Phenom 300 business jets are being told to avoid the area completely during the tests. The FAA claims that the jamming test could interfere with the business jet’s “aircraft flight stability controls.”\n\nGPS technology has become so ubiquitous that cheap jamming technology has become a real concern for both military and civilian aircraft. And if we had to speculate we’d say that these tests are probably pulling double duty for both offensive and defensive military capabilities. But honestly, that’s just a guess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese tests are naturally going to fuel plenty of conspiracy theories about mind control, weather modification, and aliens—especially with China Lake’s proximity to both large population centers like LA and Las Vegas, and the fact that Area 51 is practically just down the road. But it doesn’t take a conspiracy theorist to tell us we’re fucked if terrorists or shitty teenagers make it a habit of jamming GPS signals for everybody.\n\nIf you experience any significant GPS interference this month or know the “real” reason behind these test (aliens, right?) please let us know in the comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorrection 11:24am: This post originally misstated that one level of interference would occur at 4,000 feet. It’s 40,000 feet above sea level, and has been corrected. I regret the error.Starting today, it appears the US military will be testing a device or devices that will potentially jam GPS signals for six hours each day.
