For a title-winning team that cannot happen. This season the team is much more solid, we're much better at closing out games. We need to continue this form because of Chelsea and Manchester City.\n\n\"Maybe at the start of the season nobody put us up as high as Manchester City or Chelsea, maybe because of the signings they made, but it's ultimately demonstrated on the pitch and right now Arsenal are above them. Our objective is to keep fighting with them. We're top because up until now we've been the best team.\"\n\nWenger attributes much of the credit for his team's improvement to its new defensive fortitude. Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny have formed an authoritative central defensive partnership, Wojciech Szczesny is becoming ever more reliable, the full-backs are secure and the midfield, especially Mathieu Flamini, provides sturdy protection to the rearguard. Wenger suggests his team is now locked into a virtuous circle. Each victory is both a stride forward and a hiccup avoided and enhances the side's belief that they can last the distance.\n\n\"The consistency of the results of the team since January 2013 has strengthened that maturity and the fact that we are defensively more stable gives us more of a serene attitude and that helps a lot,\" he says.\n\nThat \"serene attitude\" makes it hard to envisage Arsenal collapsing like they did the last time they had so many points at this stage of the season. That was in 2007-08, when they had 54 points after 22 matches (compared with 51 now) but finished third after going on a wretched run of a single win in eight league games between February and early April.\n\nThat hapless streak was triggered by the horrendous injury that their striker, Eduardo, suffered during a draw at Birmingham City, but the poise of this Arsenal team suggests they would be capable of withstanding even such a traumatic misfortune.\n\nIf all the challengers have a similar level of mental strength, then the title", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

He handed in a transfer request in November 2010 having expressed his desire to join Luton Town , after they had a number of bids for him rejected and he had turned down a contract extension with York . His transfer request was rejected by manager Gary Mills and McGurk went on to explain he wanted to join Luton as he believed they offered him a better opportunity of achieving his ambition of returning to the Football League . Luton manager Richard Money eventually gave up on signing McGurk due to York demanding what he called a \" ridiculous fee \" for the player . However , another Luton bid was rejected after the transfer window opened in January 2011 .

Thus, union leaders saw May 12 not as the beginning of a campaign to mobilize labor resistance, but as a one-time-only show of force that, they hoped, would bring the mayor to the negotiating table.\n\nThe union's strategy, therefore, was to keep the protest within pre-determined limits. That proved to be no easy task, since thousands of workers and students felt the exhilaration of finally having sufficient numbers to directly confront banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nSimilarly, the organizing for May 12, while a major step forward in the number of groups it brought together, was impaired by retreats and compromises on the part of the UFT and lapses in the democratic process of the organizing committee.\n\nThe first public organizing meeting for the protest unanimously embraced the idea of organizing a Wall Street protest without a permit and the inevitable metal police pens. UFT President Michael Mulgrew even visited the meeting and gave his endorsement to the plans.\n\nHowever, as the date of the protest neared, the UFT backtracked, entering into negotiations with police for a permit, which also resulted in the location of the protest being moved away from Wall Street. The UFT also backed out of participation in the teach-ins, instead holding a rally on their own at City Hall before marching to the closing rally.\n\nA second problem was that, until the final week before the protest, all organizing meetings were scheduled during daytime weekday hours, shutting out rank-and-file workers. Meanwhile, decisions made at public meetings were often altered or reversed behind closed doors, with only inadequate or vague explanations provided for why this had been done.\n\nAnother blow to the democratic process was that some groups were excluded for being \"too radical\" and for having socialists within their ranks. Among those left out were the United National Antiwar Committee and the May 1st Coalition, which organizes New York's annual immigrants rights march.\n\nOne result of the unions' strategy of using May 12 merely as a tool for negotiation is that no next steps in the fight against budget cuts are currently being planned. This represents a missed opportunity to begin building on the demonstration's successes.\n\nBy contrast, the grassroots group New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts already has public forums on the budget planned in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island,", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

This natural gas is also generated within great expanses of long-term frozen soil known as permafrost, which mostly exists in Siberia, Greenland and Alaska: When organic matter there is decomposed by microbes under warmer, low-oxygen conditions, methane is produced.\n\nDue to man-made climate change, the world is warming at an unprecedented rate, which is beginning to unlock these caches, although the rate at which the methane is escaping skyward currently remains unclear.\n\nIn any case, melting permafrost is definitley unleashing methane gas, the second-most dangerous global warming greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm further to some degree. Within the oceans, the hydrates are becoming increasingly unstable due to both warming and increasing acidification, and the same effusion process is suspected of taking place there too.\n\nThese craters are certainly big, but methane bubbles up from the depths all the time. Rich Carey/Shutterstock\n\nIf an entire “chunk” of these hydrates suddenly becomes unstable, a lot of methane gas can escape at once. This can generate craters, such as those found beneath the surface of the Barents Sea. It’s difficult to estimate how much energy is being released in these crater forming “explosions,” but it’s not unreasonable to suggest that – at over half a mile across each – they could be energetic enough to sink ships passing above them. The evidence for this type of ship sinking, however, remains deeply tenuous.\n\nThis methane forcing itself up from the depths has likely happened before, around 56 million years ago.", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

During peak times of the day, when lots of people are using electricity, power is pulled from the batteries and sent across the state.\n\nGMP representatives say that means they won't need to turn on costly generators, which saves customers money. The battery inside someone's home also acts as an energy-efficient generator when the power goes out. It's already helped one Vermonter keep the lights on as our Alexandra Montgomery found out.\n\n\"The Powerwalls are over here,\" Andy McMahan said. \"This is it right here.

I'm told 1,200 others are on a waiting list.\n\n\"I feel like a guinea pig, to a little point,\" McMahan said. \"But someone's got to do it, right?\"\n\nMcMahan says just days after her Powerwalls were installed, a wind storm knocked out power for thousands of Vermonters, including her.\n\n\"This went on, went off, went on, went off and we're like, 'oh boy,'\" she said.\n\nMcMahan says after a call to Tesla's customer service and a few flipped switches...\n\n\"Boom!

The war on drugs has failed -- why isn't it being shut down?\n\nAs acclaimed filmmaker Eugene Jarecki's latest video shows, the war on drugs has failed in every way possible. Trying to wage the war on drugs has costs the U.S. $1 trillion, with another $51 billion adding to the tally each year. This has resulted in 45 million drug related arrests, with the U.S. now jailing 2.3 million prisoners -- more people than anyone else on the planet. What has all this accomplished? \"Rates of addiction remain unchanged, overdose deaths are at an all-time high and drugs cost less than ever before.\"\n\nWhile attitudes and opinions on drug reform are dramatically shifting in the U.S. and across the world, more needs to be done. I echo Eugene's call for U.S. citizens to urge Congress to advance the Smarter Sentencing Act. This could help put an end to racial profiling, mass incarceration, shattered communities and failed policy. The Smarter Sentencing Act will save the U.S. billions of dollars, which could be spent on helping people overcome drug dependencies. It will also ease dangerous overcrowding in prisons by reducing sentences for non-violent drug offenders.\n\nEvery day, more people agree the war on drugs has failed and must change. As the Global Commission on Drug Policy has highlighted, and campaigns like Breaking The Taboo have illustrated, it's time for the rest of the world to learn from the likes of Portugal and Uruguay, and the brave steps they have taken to treat drugs as a health problem.\n\nPoliticians must listen to the people who, as Global Commission on Drug Policy research has shown, want them to find a new way. When we visited Ironwood State Prison in California recently, it was clear that everyone from the prisoners to the guards, the families to the legislators, believe the way drug problems are treated has to change.\n\nIt's time to speak out. It's time to adopt and experiment with new approaches. It's time to ask governments around the world to study the evidence and look at the harm being done by outdated drug laws. Most importantly, it's time to start thinking about and treating drug problems as a health issue, not a criminal issue.If I started a business and it was clearly failing, I would shut it down.

He's given great effort and he has proven that he is a team player. I feel badly for Mathias because I know how important playing the game of football is to him. Let's get him healthy, back on the field, playing for the New York Giants.\"\n\nNow the Giants move on without their 2006 first-round pick, who was a valuable chess piece in Fewell's schemes. Umenyiora will have to continue his torrid pace. Since Kiwanuka has been out, Umenyiora has seven sacks and six forced fumbles.\n\n\"We had to change a little bit when Kiwi went out,\" Fewell said on Wednesday when asked about how much he had to change schematically without Kiwanuka. \"Kiwi is a special kind of guy, so we looked around and we searched for some guys to take over those roles and we have some guys that can assume that role, but not play it like Kiwi plays it, so that's a special little deal.\"\n\nThe Giants have used three safeties on the field quite a bit and safety Deon Grant sometimes lines up at linebacker. Linebacker Keith Bulluck's recent return from a toe injury helps and Fewell will need Pierre-Paul, who was drafted in the first round as a luxury, to continue his progress. Pierre-Paul doesn't have a sack yet but he has impressed coaches with his play on defense and special teams.\n\n\"He is making progress for us and we want to get him more involved and he will become more involved,\" Fewell said. \"It just depends on how much more he can handle and execute. So the more he can take on and execute, the more we'll give him. It's up to him.\"\n\nBlackmon, who played the past four seasons for the Packers, will come in and immediately compete for the kick- and punt-returning duties. Darius Reynaud, who was acquired in the Sage Rosenfels preseason trade from Minnesota, has been a disappointment. Reynaud is averaging 18.4 yards per kick return and just 5.9 yards per punt return.\n\n\"Blackmon had a very good workout for us and showed that he has recovered nicely from a serious knee injury,\" Reese said of Kiwanuka's former Boston College teammate who played in just three games last", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Jerry Brown for 20 percent cutbacks in water use and the first-ever state mandate to restrict outdoor watering, there is no consensus on how green is too green. Rules on watering are different from community to community, and so is compliance.\n\nBut irrigation irritation is rampant — and on the rise. The Santa Clara Valley Water District received almost 240 reports of water waste — mostly sprinklers spraying pavement or running off into the street — in August alone, four times the number of complaints earlier in the year. Calls to the East Bay Municipal Utility District soared in July, when it received 211 complaints.\n\nThe new state outdoor water rules, which took effect in August, have empowered water conservers to speak out “now that their concerns are being backed by the state,” said Nelsy Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for EBMUD.\n\nThis newspaper tapped into readers’ rage when we asked them to send tips about where they saw water being wasted or misused. Scores wrote in to rant about everything from leaky faucets in public restrooms to liberally watered golf courses, cemeteries, athletic fields and parks. Others are outraged over water companies slow to fix leaks and neighbors intent on keeping their lawns fit enough for a fertilizer commercial.\n\nJohns frequently passes that vacant lot in Santa Clara that’s ringed with grass. “A multi-acre lawn around the site of a building that hasn’t even been built yet takes the cake,” he wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the lot’s owner, the Sobrato Organization, didn’t want to discuss the grass or why it’s irrigated. The head of the city water department said he’d send an inspector to check it out.\n\nPearce was aghast when he spotted the Hetch Hetchy leaks pouring from a trestle that carries the giant pipes across the bay. “One of the state’s most iconic water systems should be setting a better example for conservation,” he said. “This is more than just a public-image black eye.”", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

There’s a free grocery that distributes food to the hungry, a bicycle shop, outdoor vegetable gardens, and, not unnecessarily, a shower and a clean bathroom. Once a month, there’s a free medical clinic, and on occasion, free haircuts. On Tuesdays, The Well serves dinner at the Good Samaritan Inn up Florida Ave., also with food from Metro Min; on Thursdays, there’s The Banquet. About 100 people use The Well’s services every day, and some of them depend on the place as the only home Tampa offers them. Without it, they’d have nowhere to go.\n\nThe sailing isn’t always smooth, though. Rick Fernandez, genial president of the Tampa Heights Civic Association, notes that a few months ago, he alerted Denger to “multiple complaints” he’d fielded about the The Well. There were sightings of people drinking, selling drugs, and even “people having sex back in the back areas — generally, the kinds of things you don’t want to see in your neighborhood where your children live.”\n\nBut after Fernandez conferred with Dengler, the Well’s founder held a “town hall” with his population, and Fernandez says the problem was solved — there’s been only one “minimal” complaint since. As to landlord Rattan’s decision whether or not to renew The Well’s lease, “that’s between him and his tenant,” says Fernandez. “As far as I’m concerned, Jon is being a good neighborhood member at this point.”\n\nIf The Well goes, it’s the poor and hungry who’ll feel it most. Consider Tom Logan, a regular denizen of The Well who lives in a house rented by Dengler. Tom is 64, a tall, thin Caucasian man with a bushy blondish beard and glasses. He tells me he’s been coming to The Well for about a year now.\n\n“I got here because when I first was in Tampa, I was living under a bridge in downtown.

He has worked on a host of award-winning and box office hits, including Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan. His latest film, a cold war spy drama called Bridge of Spies, came out in the fall and was nominated for several Oscars.\n\n“Through his art, Mr. Spielberg has challenged us to dream and to see the world anew, and I am very much looking forward to welcoming him back to Harvard and to honoring him during our 365th Commencement exercises,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpielberg spoke at Harvard in 2014, when he discussed his sources of inspiration and the future of cinema with humanities professor Homi K. Bhabha; in 2013, he was awarded the W.E.B. Du Bois medal for his contributions to African and African American culture. Spielberg was named the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year in 1983, one accolade among a litany.\n\nSpielberg’s career in film has spanned from the summer blockbuster to the serious period drama. Many of his early works, like E.T. the Extra-terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, became ingrained in popular culture and achieved immense financial success. His later movies, including Schindler’s List and Lincoln, earned widespread critical acclaim and engaged with difficult historical moments.\n\n“An extraordinary storyteller, he has given voice to the silenced and brought history to life,” Faust said.\n\nSpielberg’s selection is a departure from a recent set of politically-inclined Harvard Commencement speakers. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick spoke at the Afternoon Exercises in 2015, and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg addressed graduates in 2014.\n\n—Staff writer Andrew M.

The shares recovered shortly thereafter.\n\nOn the changing impact of technology on mineral exploration over the span of his lifetime, Lowell holds that it’s been “very little.” He believes that “geophysics has been very oversold,” instead favoring “drill holes and geochemistry… The best guide to ore is ore.” Lowell also voiced doubts that technology would be able to revolutionize mineral exploration the way 2D and 3D Seismic has for the oil and gas business, at least in the near future.\n\nThe commodities super-cycle is in tact, Lowell believes. There’s elasticity in mining companies’ profit margins, he told us, but not in the demand for the underlying commodities they produce. For that reason, large, undeveloped, low grade copper deposits will need to be put into production, sooner than later.\n\nWhen asked about his favourite jurisdictions for exploration currently, he told us he favors Chile, Peru, New Guinea, Mongolia, Nevada, and some parts of Africa. But he qualified his dispositions by recalling that attractive jurisdictions are constantly changing. “Places like Arizona were very attractive as a place to explore for copper deposits, and now Arizona is about as bad as Venezuela,” he chuckled.\n\nWhen we moved on to the role luck has played in his career, Lowell avoided answering directly. Instead he responded that “minefinders who make one discovery are much more likely to find another.” His basic philosophy is that of persistence, and it shows — his career is equally productive after retirement age as it was before.\n\nAt age eighty-four, Lowell is not slowing down. With financiers Dave De Witt and Marcel De Groot of Pathway Capital (“as efficient, honest and reliable as partners get”), Lowell is developing several projects, including a titanium-iron deposit in Paraguay, which he believes is the largest of its kind in the world. Other active projects are under wraps for now, as to avoid competition. Investors who rode his Arequipa Resources shares from .20 to $30.00 in 1995 will surely be watching Lowell’s upcoming public ventures.

MacDermid is defenseless at this point and could have been seriously hurt. I certainly would expect better of a guy that was once considered the heavyweight champ of the NHL.

{"id": "sample_5_54", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " is the candidate who comes across as more presidential. And that was Romney.\n\nBut there was one thing that Romney and his winning personality promised on Wednesday night that the hard numbers indicate he cannot deliver: he cannot reduce the deficit with his plan. If Obama said anything that was true, it was this: \"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals are currently taking advantage of, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\" He later added, \"It's math, arithmetic.\"\n\nRomney protested that he was not asking for $5 trillion in tax cuts — which I think is too bad. And in the governor's defense, Obama's relentless rhetoric about \"loopholes\" and \"deductions\" for \"upper-income individuals\" could be true — or it could be the same, tired, class warfare drivel the Democrats have been peddling for as long as I've been alive. But that \"$2 trillion in additional military spending\" is something Romney did not even attempt to protest.\n\nFor me, whatever hope I had that Romney would be a dramatic improvement over Obama was not dashed during the debate. It was dashed last May, when CNN reported that although Romney \"is campaigning on a platform that emphasizes less spending, smaller deficits, and renewed fiscal responsibility ... in one budget area, Romney is running the opposite direction. The former Massachusetts governor wants to increase defense spending by leaps and bounds. By one estimate, additional spending would exceed $2 trillion over the next decade.\"\n\nThe need to cut military spending is something I have emphasized in columns for so long and so often that at least one of my editors has asked me to stop talking about it. Indeed, if there's an issue I could be accused of being fanatical about, the dire need for cutting \"defense\" spending is it.\n\nBut Romney's platform proves my point. If our annual deficit is between $1-1.5 trillion, and neither candidate is really serious about cutting entitlement costs which are far, far greater, how can anyone even pretend they'll reduce the deficit while increasing spending on our military by $2 trillion?\n\nWe currently spend more on our military than we ever have, and most of that money goes to fund a massive bureaucracy that has little to do with our actual defense. The result: our soldiers are not paid enough, do not receive the proper benefits, and do not have the necessary weapons or essentials.\n\n", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 511}}

The manager's faith - selecting him ahead of £32m Christian Benteke at Stamford Bridge and Etihad Stadium - has brought out the best in him. The results prove the wisdom of that choice.\n\nKlopp has lost just once in seven games in charge at Liverpool\n\nKlopp also knew Emre Can well from when he played at Bayer Leverkusen and made what should have been the relatively simple choice of playing him in his best position in midfield.\n\nCan struggled at right-back and in a three-man central defence. There was a good reason for this. He is not a right-back or a central defender.\n\nHe is a midfield player, Klopp has played him there and Can proved his class and vision with a brilliant backheel that allowed Coutinho to set up Firmino for Liverpool's third.\n\nSo while the new coach has brought a big managerial personality to Liverpool, he has also applied sound logic. Together it makes a potent combination.\n\nBeating rivals brings a new belief\n\nKlopp has not had an easy introduction at Liverpool, but away from Anfield he has made light work of a daunting list of fixtures.\n\nHe opened his reign with a goalless draw at Tottenham but the wins at reigning champions Chelsea and title favourites Manchester City have spoken most eloquently of how he has quickly instilled belief into a team that had lost its way in the 18 months before his arrival.\n\nRodgers did not beat a top-four team until his ninth attempt and had only one win in his first 12. Furthermore, it took until his eighth attempt to beat a top-four side away from home. Klopp has won his first two.\n\nKlopp's reputation as one of Europe's premier coaches brings belief and confidence of its own and one of his early successes is how quickly he has been able to transmit it to players who were so short on those precious commodities.\n\nRodgers' first eight games against the 'big four' Liverpool 2-2 Man City Drew Liverpool 0-2 Arsenal Lost Liverpool 1-2 Man Utd Lost Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool Drew Man Utd 2-1 Liverpool Lost Arsenal 2-2 Liverpool Drew Man City 2-", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_5_59", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " intestinal linings. To the true believers, however, these linings aren’t the results of bleach killing their children’s intestinal cells, rather they are parasitic “rope worms,” and their presence in a child’s discharge confirms that the MMS is doing its job.\n\nSummary of supposed effects\n\nTo review, this chemical is supposedly able to cure an extremely broad array of aliments, each of which requires a different mechanism. A mechanism that kills bacteria won’t cure cancer, won’t treat snake venom, won’t suppress the immune system, won’t cause hair to grow, won’t cure Down syndrome, etc. It just isn’t plausible for one chemical to do all of these things. Now, you may be thinking, “fine, maybe the claims are exaggerated, but just because it doesn’t cure all of these doesn’t mean that it can’t cure some of them.” That is true, but there are still several problems. First, without rigorous testing, you have no way of knowing which (if any) ailment it actually treats, and you have no reason to trust the people selling this stuff. I think that I have clearly demonstrated that at least some of the claims about MMS are scientifically incorrect. This means that the people making these claims are either dishonest or ignorant. Either way, you shouldn’t be getting medical advice from them. Second, without rigorous testing, you don’t know if it is safe. There are, for example, many things that will kill bacteria (such as iodine, gasoline, Clorox, rubbing alcohol, etc.), but that doesn’t mean that drinking them is a good idea.\n\nIs the scientific evidence to support these claims?\n\nEvery once in a great while, a truly extraordinary claim turns out to be true, but we need some really solid evidence before concluding that it is true. So, are the claims of MMS peddlers supported by science? NO! There is not a scrap of scientific evidence that ingesting MMS does anything beneficial! The only “studies” are poorly designed, uncontrolled, and self-reported tests that were conducted by the inventor of MMS (Jim Humble). You can read about his “tests” in one of his many books which he would be more than happy to sell to you.

After being there just a short while, they both, literally, ran out of my building and quit after having experiences inside. As a result construction has slowed a bit, thus resulting in a delay in opening the museum to the public. Rest assured I’m as anxious to get this place open as anybody, and as soon as I have a concrete opening date, you’ll be the first to know about it.”\n\nInterestingly enough, “The construction guys quitting actually caused us to investigate the place for an episode of ‘Ghost Adventures.’ The museum… it will touch you. You hear voices. You feel cold energies pass through you. There’s never been anything like it.”\n\nSpeaking of the new season and what to expect from the show that started it all:\n\n“In the new season we decided to return to Winchester Mystery House. Our first investigation there was the ONLY one in ‘Ghost Adventures’ history that we had to stop in the middle of because of something very serious that happened to me. We also have an episode coming up in which for the first time Billy [Tolley] completely loses himself during an investigation of a demonic infestation, which results in some of the most chilling evidence to date. That place is described as the ‘House of Evil.’”\n\nFour remaining brand-new episodes from last season will premiere beginning on July 16th.\n\nFor more info visit “Ghost Adventures” on Travel Channel, and “like” “Ghost Adventures” on Facebook.

A British accent provides a \"splash of otherness\", when set alongside it.\n\nAmerican viewers of Game of Thrones also get a coherent range of accents from all of the British Isles.\n\nWhere is Tolkien's Middle Earth? JRR Tolkien gave differing explanations as to the setting for his story\n\nHe described The Lord of the Rings as taking place in \"the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea\"\n\nThis has been interpreted by fans as being a link to north-western Europe and Britain in particular\n\nIn the complex array of languages he created for the books, the influence of Old English, Old Norse, Gothic, Welsh and Finnish have all been identified\n\nThose from the north of the fantasy world tend to speak mostly with either northern English or Scottish accents. In the first series, Yorkshiremen Sean Bean and Mark Addy played their parts with their own accents. There are also characters with an Irish tinge.\n\nBritish audiences are used to seeing imported US shows - like House or The Wire - with British actors doing American accents.\n\nBut Game of Thrones, much of which was filmed in Northern Ireland, has only one American actor as a central character", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Prior to the storm in October 2012, a terminal rehabilitation project had been planned to repair and update signals, switches and track. Sandy made the project critical when storm surge flooded SIR tracks and the entire St. George yard complex with corrosive saltwater, highlighting areas where flood protection or protective infrastructure needed to be installed. The saltwater significantly damaged all 12 tracks, multiple switches, equipment and cables, as well as facilities and the train control tower.\n\n“With careful planning and foresight, we took this opportunity to not only make critical Sandy-related repairs but to do it better using environmentally friendly materials,” said Doug Connett, vice president and chief officer for Staten Island Railway.\n\nNYCT started the St. George renewal project in September 2014, with plans to integrate resiliency measures while replacing outdated or damaged equipment and making repairs. Those resiliency measures include raising signal equipment to 72 inches above the tracks, raising platforms for battery and generator enclosures and installing a new third rail system.\n\nRepairs at St. George include the replacement of 12,000 linear feet of track and installation of a total of approximately 7,500 high-density plastic rail ties. The ties, which are made of 100 percent recycled materials, were manufactured by Axion International.\n\nThe change in track tie materials from wood to high-density plastic stems from a recommendation made by the MTA’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Sustainability, which released a report in 2009 on ways to operate a greener transit system throughout the New York area. The commission’s final report made nearly 100 recommendations to reduce the MTA’s carbon footprint while generating savings and economic growth, one of which included a recommendation that the MTA expand procurement of sustainable railroad ties across all rail agencies.\n\nThe $105-million St. George Terminal project is taking place with no service interruptions to customers and is 55 percent complete with composite tie installation to be completed by June", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

When she was asked to respond to Joe Biden ’s critique of the McCain health care plan, she announced: “I would like to respond about the tax increases,” cheerfully ignoring the fact that tax increases had never been mentioned.\n\nAfter the recent Katie Couric unpleasantness, Palin told the viewers that this time they were getting a chance to hear her “answer these tough questions without the filter.” And, indeed, her answers were murky in the extreme. She railed repeatedly about government regulations getting in the way of the private sector, then announced that the financial rescue plan “has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving.” She said that she didn’t want to discuss what caused global warming , only how to ease its impact.\n\nShe appeared to agree with Dick Cheney ’s manic theory that the vice president is a member of both the executive and legislative branches, although it’s hard to tell since she began her answer this way: “Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the office of the vice president.

On that date , Murphy advanced carrying a SCR @-@ 536 radio for 50 yards ( 46 m ) towards the Germans while they continually fired directly at him .

But I do know now, after being informed, that it is standard protocol that a pitcher will get three games and can appeal and a manager gets one and can’t.”\n\nTheir ejections came in the top of the ninth against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Great American Ball Park after Ohlendorf hit David Freese with a fastball. Since both benches had been warned earlier in the game after two other hit batters, ejections of the pitcher and his manager were a foregone conclusion.\n\nIt was the suspensions that caught them off guard, although they have become standard operating procedure for how MLB deals with beanball ejections. That fact has seemingly not filtered its way down to many.\n\n“I didn’t know, so I don’t think (many guys know),” Ohlendorf said. “It doesn’t happen all that often. I was surprised.”\n\nOhlendorf maintained after his ejection that hitting Freese was unintentional, but said he understood he had to be removed from the game by rule in order to ease tensions. He doesn’t think a suspension is fair, though.\n\n“Whether I’ll win or not, I don’t know, but I thought the right thing to do was to appeal it,” he said. “Hopefully I do win, but we’ll see what happens.”\n\nEven if Ohlendorf does win, Price doesn’t expect the league to wipe his slate clean. It’s more likely, Price said, that the suspension will be reduced by a game or two when Ohlendorf’s case is heard. A date for his appeal has not been set.\n\nManagers are not given the recourse to appeal, which Price said he understands.

The Hornets did what they needed to on offense, outscoring the Nets 52-36 in the paint, while also taking care of the ball, committing just 11 turnovers (for the season, they rank second in the league at 11.9 a game).\n\nBut defensively, Charlotte couldn’t make enough stops consistently, particularly from the 3-point line. Brooklyn shot 15-31 from beyond the arc, which isn’t good no matter the opponent, but even worse given the Nets rank 29th in the league in 3-point percentage, shooting just 32.8 percent as a team. Both Bojan Bogdanovic and Sean Kilpatrick made 4-7, and of the nine players that attempted a 3-pointer, Joe Harris was the only player who didn’t make one.\n\nBrooklyn did most of their damage in the second and fourth quarters, making five from beyond the arc in each. In the second quarter, Charlotte went on a 7-0 run to extend their lead to 51-38 with 8:44 remaining, forcing Brooklyn to call timeout. At this point it felt as if Charlotte was on the verge of turning a 13 point lead into one of 20 points or more, but Brooklyn managed to trim the deficit, countering Charlotte’s 2-pointers with 3’s, and eventually getting to within six. While Charlotte went into halftime up nine, it was another wasted opportunity to put away an inferior team.\n\nIn the fourth, Charlotte failed on four occasions to make a needed stop. After going down by six with 4:18 remaining, Marvin Williams connected from 3 to cut the score in half, but Kilpatrick answered with a 3 of his own to push it back to six. Forty seconds later, Nicolas Batum put Charlotte right back in it after drawing and converting a four point play. Then, after actually getting a defensive stop, Cody Zeller tied it up. Then, Charlotte gave the lead right back, allowing Kilpatrick to knock down his second of the quarter. Bogdanovic launched a 3-pointer over the semi-outstretched hand of Batum, giving Brooklyn a four point lead with a 1:06 remaining. This one was more frustrating than than the previous two, given that Batum sort of let Bogdanovic shoot over him.\n\nAnd yet despite all of this, the Hornets found themselves up one with 2.3 seconds remaining, until Randy Foye made his only shot of the game:", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_5_105", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " $9.5 figure should therefore be considered an upper bound.\n\nThese calculations nevertheless indicate the potential for substantial revenue from marijuana taxation. A more modest excise tax, such as one that raises the price 50%, would produce revenue on legalized marijuana of $6.2 billion per year.\n\nDistribution of the Marijuana Tax Revenue\n\nThe estimates of tax revenue discussed so far indicate the total amount that could be collected summing over all levels of government. In practice this total would be divided between state and federal governments. It is therefore useful to estimate how much revenue would accrue to each state, and to state governments versus the federal government, under plausible assumptions.\n\nTable 4a indicates the tax revenue that would accrue to each state and to the federal government under the assumption that each state collected revenue equal to 10% of the income generated by legalized marijuana and the federal government collected income equal to 20%. This is approximately what occurs now for the economy overall, except that the ratio of tax revenues to income varies across states from the 10% figure assumed here. The table indicates that under these assumptions, the federal government would collect $1.6 billion in additional revenue while on average each state would collect $16 million in additional tax revenue.\n\nThese calculations ignore the fact that marijuana use rates differ across states, so application of identical policies would yield different amounts of revenue per capita. Wright (2002, Table A.4, p.82), for example, indicates that the percent of those 12 and over reporting marijuana use in the past month ranged in 1999-2000 from a low of 2.79% in Iowa to a high of 9.03% in Massachusetts. Table 4b therefore shows the breakdown of revenue by state under the assumption that tax revenue is proportional to state marijuana use rates. A third possibility, which cannot easily be examined with existing data, is that revenue by state differs depending on the distribution of marijuana production.\n\nV. Summary\n\nThis report has estimated the budgetary implications of legalizing marijuana and taxing and regulating it like other goods. According to the calculations here, legalization would reduce government expenditure by $5.3 billion at the state and local level and by $2.4 billion at the federal level. In addition, marijuana legalization would generate tax revenue of $2.4 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like all other goods and $6.2 billion annually if marijuana were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco.\n\nReferences\n\nBaicker, Katherine and Mireille Jacobson", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

This is not standard policy and will not be repeated again.\"\n\nGallo-Chasanoff said she wasn't the only person given a question.\n\n\"After the event,\" she said, \"I heard another man ... talking about the question he asked, and he said that the campaign had asked him to ask that question.\"\n\nThe man she referenced prefaced his question by saying that it probably didn't have anything to do with energy, and then posed the following: \"I wonder what you propose to do to create jobs for the middle-class person, such as here in Newton where we lost Maytag.\"\n\nA Maytag factory in Newton recently closed, forcing hundreds of people out of their jobs.\n\nDuring the course of the late-night interview on Grinnell's campus, Gallo-Chasanoff also said that the day before the school's newspaper, Scarlet and Black, printed the story, she wanted the reporter to inform the campaign out of courtesy to let them know it would be published.\n\nShe said the \"head of publicity for the campaign,\" a man whose name she could not recall, had no factual disputes with the story. But, she added, a Clinton intern spoke to her to say the campaign requested she not talk about the story to any more media outlets and that if she did she should inform a staffer.\n\n\"I'm not under any real obligation to do that, and I haven't talked to [the campaign] anymore,\" Gallo-Chasanoff said, adding that she doesn't plan to.\n\n\"If what I do is come and just be totally truthful, then that's all anyone can ask of me, and that's all I can ask of myself. So I'll feel good with what I've done. I'll feel like I've done the right thing.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign's acknowledgment that it planted a question reinforces a widely held criticism of the senator -- that she is not entirely honest, said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst.\n\n\"It's the same criticism often", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It's a criminal offense that typically arises from drunken-driving convictions and habitual traffic offenses, and the penalties can include fines up to $2,500 and jail time.Some drivers who lose their licenses continue to drive, taking their chances that they won't get caught, Appleton Police Capt. Todd Freeman said. He noted that operating while suspended \"is a very common offense that officers run into daily.\"There might be some motorists who don't realize their licenses are suspended but far more know and choose to risk it anyway, he said.\"They're playing that game of whether they are going to get stopped,\" he said. \"They need to work to pay their tickets, but they can't legally drive until they get their license back.\"Advertisement More than 88,000 drove without a license in Wisconsin in 2013 Driving with suspended license only carries $124 fine Share Shares Copy Link Copy\n\nTens of thousands of Wisconsin drivers continue to drive even though their licenses have been suspended or revoked.More than 74,000 people were convicted last year of driving with a suspended license, and another 14,000 people were convicted of driving with a revoked license, the Post-Crescent Media reported.For some drivers, having their licenses suspended or revoked doesn't", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_5_124", "config_id": 5, "prompt": ", so we asked to New Media Rights attorney Teri Karobonik for some tips on navigating ContentID.\n\nTubefilter: Are there steps YouTube creators can take in order to ‘safeguard’ their videos from invalid ContentID claims? If so, what are they?\n\nTeri Karobonik: It’s hard to entirely prevent a ContentID claim. However, we recommend that creators use only use as much copyrighted content as they absolutely need to make their point. Also, in the wake of the drastic rise in ContentID claims, which involved ContentID matches to in-game music, creators incorporating video game footage in their videos should mute background music in game.\n\nWhen in doubt, get a license or used openly licensed content (like Creative Commons). We have a great guide on finding openly licensed content.\n\nTF: How can YouTube musicians protect cover songs from ContentID claims?\n\nTK: Cover songs, without the proper licenses, actually violate copyright law and can result in ContentID claims and DMCA takedowns. Some services (like Loudr) have recently popped up to help cover writers get the proper licenses for their cover songs. If you have a written license, it will be much easier to get the situation resolved if your video gets monetized or taken down.\n\nTF: How can YouTube creators tell what is considered fair use and what is not? That is, where is the “line” between fair use and copyright infringement?\n\nTK: Fair use is complex, and even for experienced lawyers, it’s very hard to tell where the ‘line’ is between fair use and copyright infringement. Unfortunately, most of the easy ‘fair use rules’ are myths; it’s not true that it’s OK to only use 20 seconds of a work, nor is journalistic use always allowed. It’s never a good idea to rely on legal myths when you’re creating your videos.\n\nFair use relies on a complex four-factor balancing test to determine if reuse is OK. If you’re unsure if your use qualifies as fair use, we strongly recommend you speak to an attorney (like the ones at New Media Rights) who can help you navigate the factors.\n\n(Ed. note: Here is Teri’s complete explanation of the four factors that determine fair use:)\n\nFactor 1 The first factor examines if your work is", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

If Paul O'Connell ha a headache, by all means Paul, take a paracetamol.

{"id": "sample_5_141", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is changing its mind about \"screen time\" – or at least bringing its stance into the full-blown digital age.\n\nThe impending revision of the AAP's policy statement, announced in October, is driven by an acknowledgment that its current screen-time guidelines, best known for nixing any screen time for children under 2 and limiting older kids and teenagers to two hours a day, are outdated. Some of the current advice predates widespread Internet use.\n\n\"The problem is that technology moves faster than science can study it,\" says Dr. Ari Brown, a practicing pediatrician and chair of the AAP Children, Adolescents and Media Leadership Work Group, via email. \"Our previous recommendations were made because we had enough health and developmental concerns about potential risk of TV use to advise parents about it.\"\n\nWith schools eagerly implementing technology wherever funding allows, not to mention grade-school enrichment classes on coding, software that lets kids compose music on computers and strong anecdotal evidence that playing Minecraft can benefit kids with autism, espousing strict minimization ignores the obvious. Today's kids are \"digital natives.\" Technology is in their blood.\n\nThe AAP's new view, summarized in \"Beyond 'turn it off': How to advise families on media use,\" sees TVs, computers, gaming systems, smartphones and tablets as mere tools. Time spent with them can be good for kids or bad for kids, depending on how they're used.\n\nThe AAP made addressing children and media a top priority starting in 2012, a focus that culminated in the May 2015 \"Growing Up Digital\" symposium. The conference brought together experts on child development, social science, pediatrics, media, neuroscience and education, and called attention to the growing body of evidence supporting the potential (and potentially significant) benefits of screen time in child and adolescent development.\n\nAt the symposium, social scientists presented data showing that when teens connect online, those peer connections can be \"significantly meaningful,\" and sometimes \"more supportive than their real life friendships,\" reports Brown.\n\nThe implication, she says, is that \"there are some very positive [online] opportunities for acceptance and support as teens develop their identity and self-esteem.\"\n\nOther insights pointed to possible ways to strengthen digital media's teaching potential. Neuroscientists, she says, presented research showing that 2-year-olds learn novel words as well by video chat as they do by live communication, suggesting it's the two-way interaction that matters most", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

This is obviously a completely new dimension of organised crime,” he tweeted.\n\nBarbara Steffens, the minister for emancipation in the North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) government, said the New Year’s Eve incident was “the tip of a very unpleasant iceberg”. She called for a “larger societal condemnation of a male abuse of power”.\n\nThe density of the crowds in Cologne meant that hundreds of police were deployed on Thursday night. Questions are being asked as to how they failed to realise until much later that crimes were taking place on such a large scale. Police say the full extent of the attacks only became clear in the following days as increasing numbers of victims began to come forward. It is believed that many women have yet to report assaults, and police appealed for people who had not already done so to come forward.\n\nArnold Plickert, head of the police trade union in NRW, told the Deutsche Presse Agentur that the incidents were “of a new quality … What we’ve been able to establish is that this is an organised method.”\n\nHe said questions needed to be asked as to “how it was possible that this thousand-strong group was able to come to Cologne and meet up there”.\n\nPolice in Hamburg said some aspects of the attackers’ methods were akin to those of skilled pickpockets operating in the city.\n\nOfficers of Operation New Year, set up to investigate the attacks, will examine CCTV footage from in and around the station in an effort to identify perpetrators. Reker said a discussion on installing further cameras would form part of her emergency talks.\n\nOne of the victims, identified only as Katja L, told the Kölner Express: “When we came out of the station, we were very surprised by the group we met, which was made up only of foreign men … We walked through the group of men, there was a tunnel through them, we walked through … I was groped everywhere. It was a nightmare. Although we shouted and hit them, they men didn’t stop.

This is not the first time we’ve seen polls with this stark divide within the party. For the last several years we have been seeing polls showing that the Democratic base is slowly divorcing itself from Israel, and much of that dropping support is happening along generational lines as well.\n\nIn December 2014 Shibley Telhami and Katayoun Kishi wrote in the Washington Post on a recent American public opinion survey on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of the trends they pointed out was the generational divide brewing within the party on the issue:\n\nGenerally, younger adults (ages 18 to 29) tend much more to want the United States to lean toward neither side. But among young Democratic respondents, the results are more striking: Among those who want the United States to lean toward one side or the other, more young people want the United States to lean toward the Palestinians than toward the Israelis (12 percent vs. 10 percent, respectively). This attitude is unique among this age group, as only 5 percent or less of Democrats in each older age group want the United States to lean toward the Palestinians.\n\nThis was also seen in the summer of 2014 while Israel was attacking Gaza. A Gallup poll taken at the time found young people and Democrats increasing saw Israel’s actions as “unjustified“:\n\n51% of Americans 18-29 years old think the Israeli attack is unjustified. Most support from Israel comes from ages 50 and up …the majority of Republican identifiers back what Israel is doing. Meanwhile, Democrats take the opposing view, with nearly half saying Israel’s actions are unjustified.\n\nAnd this is was not the first time this trend was identified. A year earlier the late Leonard Fein reported on a Pew Research Center survey for the Forward and asked, “Is Israel Losing Young Democrats?” Fein wrote,\n\nWhen it comes to Americans", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Feel inspired!\n\nIf you’re still hesitating if RoR is the best choice for you, here are top 10 famous websites built with Ruby on Rails. Feel inspired!\n\n1 - Twitter (in its early days)\n\nWe’re putting Twitter on our list as it was originally built with Ruby on Rails in 2006. With the growth of its popularity, after five years, founders have switched from RoR to Java server.\n\nI guess there’s no need to introduce ;-)\n\n3 - Yellow pages\n\nFamous book with business directories and telephones stepped into the virtual world, known as the Internet Yellow Pages or IYP. Ruby on Rails based website, the biggest one that IT&T runs.\n\n4 - Hulu\n\nAdd-supported online video service, a favorite site of almost every Family Guy fan. Founded in 2007, offers a wide selection of TV shows, etc. Sort of free TV on your computer.\n\n5 - Slideshare\n\nE-learning platform that allows you to upload and share presentations.

The most popular code hosting service in the world with over 9 million users and 21.1 million repositories. (in 2015)\n\n7 - Shopify\n\nE-commerce shop that allows users to build an online store. Necessity is the mother of invention - it was created in 2004 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake as the already existing e-commerce sites were unsatisfying.\n\n8 - Groupon\n\nWell known to every bargain hunter. The website which main idea is to offer coupons for deals to its local or international subscribers.

We only have a limited time on this planet so make it count\n\nThere are various theories that with the advances in science and medicine many of us will live past the age of 200, and possibly a lot longer than that. Age reversal, stem cell technology and the curing of various diseases are just some of the ways this will be possible, but so far all of this is still in the development stage.\n\nWe can’t expect to solely rely on the idea that we will always be here. Most of us see death as a taboo subject and we naively believe that we will be around forever, but we should be living our lives as if there is a time limit.\n\nThat timer is counting down and we have no idea when it reaches zero, so why are we wasting most of our time doing the things we don’t want?\n\n2. When you look back on your life, you never wish for a bigger bank balance\n\nThink of your life like a book that is being written and will be published when your time is up. I’m fairly sure that you can’t fill up a book with your bank balance so what else is there?\n\nEach chapter of this book should be focused on a different aspect of your life and to enable this to happen, your life should be as varied and eventful as possible. Spending countless hours every week for years on end working yourself into the ground will not make a very good book, not unless you are making a difference with your job and/or money.\n\nWhen people look back on their lives they never wish they could have spent more time in the office so take note of this now and do something about it.\n\n3. There is no point having money if you have no time to spend it\n\nThere are many people out there who just love to hoard money away in the hope that one day they will eventually have enough to retire. These hoarders actually have a scarcity mind-set and are afraid of losing their hard earned cash. The truth is, no amount of money will ever be enough for them and they see their increasing bank balance as a barometer of their success.\n\nIt would be unfair to call these people ‘tight’ as a refusal to spend money can also be attributed to a lack of hobbies or social life. It’s certainly easier to spend 70 hours a week in the office if you feel like you have nothing fun to do", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

That is when I saw that your car had special license plates proclaiming your membership of the New York State Senate.\n\nA red light stopped you at the next intersection. I rode alongside you and, more cautiously, tapped again on your window. You rolled it down. I could tell by your face that you weren’t happy to be talking again to this particular New York State citizen, on whose behalf you govern.\n\nI asked you, “What is your name, Senator?”\n\nYou said, “Senator Jeff Klein.” This is how I know it was you.\n\nNow, the thing is, Senator, I don’t particularly call you to task for calling me a [f***ing a**hole].

The official, who is familiar with the plans, was not authorized to discuss the possible changes publicly because no decisions have yet been made.\n\nThe options under consideration include placing U.S. advisers alongside local combat units in Iraq and embedding a small number of U.S. advisers with Syrian forces fighting the Islamic State, the official said.\n\nThe White House would need to approve any U.S. military expansion on the ground. President Obama has warned against expanding the U.S. role beyond its defined mission and inadvertently ushering in another Mideast war. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Wednesday that U.S. strategy in both countries would remain limited to supporting local forces working to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nLast week, American Special Forces soldiers accompanied Kurdish units on a successful mission to rescue 70 prisoners from the Islamic State. A U.S. soldier, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, was killed in the fighting. The Pentagon said U.S. forces would assist in future raids if conditions warranted. The U.S. military currently has about 3,400 troops in Iraq, mostly serving in an advise-and-assist mission for Iraq’s military.\n\nMarine Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged this week that the military is considering new options in Iraq and Syria but declined to give specifics. “We're continuing to examine ways to enhance the effectiveness of our operations,” he said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe Pentagon hopes moving advisers closer to combat will bolster local forces' advance in the key cities of Ramadi, an influential Sunni city in western Iraq, and Raqqa, the de facto Syrian capital of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.\n\nIn Iraq, the military has struggled to recapture Ramadi, which fell to militants in May, but Iraqi troops have been closing in on its city center for the past week.", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

In the very first issue he worked on, for example, he accompanied a piece discussing taste as a matter of perception by having the food 3D-rendered in a crude, rough way.\n\nWhen faced with illustrating a feature on Vietnamese desserts, he played up their monotone tan colours, asking Pete Deevakul to shoot straightforward, unprepossessing shots of even the most high-end recipes against a similarly bland background (including renowned pâtissier Pierre Hermé’s coffee macaron). The result is irreverent yet appetising, words that have come to define Lucky Peach’s brand.\n\n“When you pick up Lucky Peach, you should expect to be in for something different visually,” says Washburn. “There’s a looseness and playfulness that is pretty unique. We’re not afraid of making mistakes. In fact, we avoid being too structured, which would make us boring. And we try not to take ourselves too seriously.\n\n“Even the most beautiful piece needs to have a humorous note. Essentially, it needs to feel like it’s a magazine made by real people.”\n\nHe adds that Deevakul exemplifies what he looks for in a photographer when he’s scouring blogs and Instagram people who have a visual voice that is uniquely their own. Washburn is also on the lookout for individuals who have a strong personality, because he likes to know what to expect, and he is especially drawn to those who can turn seemingly mundane objects into art. “Pete can make a bottle of water look mesmerising,” he says, laughing.\n\nAnd as much as he likes to work with long-term collaborators such as Deevakul, Washburn is also keen to use new photographers in every issue to help keep the magazine looking fresh. “Beyond that, we just try to push ourselves with each shoot,” he says.\n\n“We want the process", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

But here’s a consolation for those wanting to hear Boone sing again—and it’s for a good cause.\n\nTimed to the premiere of the FX drama’s seventh and final season, Rock the Cause Records will release Boone’s cover of the Sonny Bono-penned classic “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” featuring producer/singer/songwriter Kevin Bowe to iTunes on Sept. 9. Net proceeds of the song will benefit the nonprofit label, which has raised more than a million dollars for various charities, to help support the organization’s internal operating expenses. EW has the premiere below.\n\nThough there are no plans to use the song on the show, it does have ties to Sons: Last March, Boone and his castmates Kim Coates (Tig) and Theo Rossi (Juice) toured Australia for a series of moderated Q&As and invited Bowe to serve as the house band. Each night, Boone joined Bowe onstage to reimagine the song Nancy Sinatra made famous. A few months later, back in Los Angeles, Boone laid down the deep, dark vocals to Bowe’s backing tracks at the home studio of Three Dog Night’s Danny Hutton.\n\nWhile the song itself is having a moment—Lady Gaga and Beyoncé have also recently covered it—it’s especially fitting as anxious Sons of Anarchy fans wait to see who will survive the show’s epic conclusion.

Against Labor: How U.S. Employers Organized to Defeat Union Activism is a collection of scholarly essays edited by Rosemary Feurer and Chad Pearson.\n\nThe essays that comprise Against Labor cover a period that stretches from the late 1880s to the Clinton era. Elizabeth Esch and David Roediger explore the racist assumptions that were built into so-called “scientific management.” The men with the stopwatches who broke production down into ever smaller tasks had ethnic preferences for each: Lithuanians for grinding steel, “American Poles” for forging, never Mexicans for the night shift and so on. A happy (for management) side effect of this speed up was the simmering resentment between different nationalities that hindered workplace solidarity.\n\nChad Pearson shines a light on Progressive-era worker organizations that were created and propped up by employers to help workers resist “union monopolies.” In other words, they created unions for scabs to break strikes and open up closed union shops.\n\nRobert H. Woodrum looks at the use of the Ku Klux Klan and employer-sponsored vigilantism to run union organizers out of the Alabama docks and reverse the modest gains southern workers made during World War I. Michael Dennis updates the southern picture by documenting the UFCW’s sustained, large-scale organizing drive in non-union Virginia supermarkets in the early 1990s. Already facing enormous competitive pressure from Walmart, the supermarkets dug in for a years-long fight with little concern for the law. The story is a perfectly concise example of just how broken the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was as a venue for protecting workers by the time Bill Clinton took office.\n\nNone of these stories are particularly earth-shattering revelations to people who study unions and union-busting. What’s most notable is how employer tactics get recycled and adapted from era to era, and that no era was free from union-busting. That’s a key point of Against Labor. Editors Feurer and Pearson place their collection squarely within the new body of scholarship on the “rise of the right.”\n\nContrary to a popular narrative that has an activist right wing resurging in the years", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Take this path and you’ll see your grandparents tomorrow night”\n\nAt that very moment, the monster guarding the path on the right began to screech and howl a horrible blood-curdling howl. Fire belched from its mouth; smoke poured from its nose. The little girl was terribly frightened!\n\nShe bolted toward the monster on the left! As she got closer, she noticed that the monster on the left was not as ugly as the one on the right; and it was definitely not as scary. The closer she came to the one on the left, the louder the one on the right howled. She was so confused that she did not know what to do.\n\nThe monster on the left spoke in a soft voice, “Trust me. I am not as ugly as that other monster, and I do not make those disgusting noises.” With that, the monster on the right screamed and gurgled and snorted and puffed even more. She began to take the path to the left, fearful even more that if she did not hurry, the other monster would chase after her and tear her to shreds.\n\nA few hundred yards down the left path she looked back to see if the other monster was chasing her. It was still standing at the fork in the path, and it was screaming and howling more and more. But it was not chasing her, and then she stopped. The monster on the left path was walking a few steps ahead of her, and it just smiled at her, somewhat condescendingly, as if to say, “Don’t be a fool.”\n\nAnd then something inside of her told her to go back and take the right path. The closer she came to the fork in the road, the faster she ran, until only seconds later, she was running down the right path and up into the mountains. She didn’t know why she had made this choice, but she just kept going. As the last bit of twilight drifted into the blackness of night, she looked down the mountainside from whence she had come, she could see the fork in the path, and she could see the path she had taken as well as the one that she almost took.\n\nThen she heard a thundering, rumbling, smashing, crashing, crushing sound that came from the left", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Hamilton said on social media. “Surely, you must understand that people are laughing at your liberalism, you nitwits?”\n\nHamilton also quipped over whether or not the youth would focus on bestiality next.\n\n“And what other challenges facing society is on the top 100-list for Stockholm’s Liberal Youth? Sex with hippos?” he said.\n\nDespite the shocking subject matter, the group’s move is unsurprising to many given the growing effort by some liberals to normalize behaviors deemed reprehensible by the rest of society.\n\nFor example, left-wing news outlet’s such as Salon have spent the", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_5_212", "config_id": 5, "prompt": "�You just listen” or “Just you listen” or “Just listen.” It’s common with imperatives. Get a grip on quidem. It’s a particle, one of the only ones in Latin. Either translate it “yes” or “(it’s) true” or don’t translate it at all. It implies or points forward to a contrast, usually marked by the word sed (but). For example, the sentence homo stultus quidem est, sed bonus means “The guy is an idiot, it’s true, but he’s good.” You could also translate that “The guy is an idiot, yes, but he’s good” or “The guy is an idiot, but he’s good.” Never translate it “indeed” since it doesn’t mean that in the English of 2016. Don’t know the meaning of a Latin word? If it’s a verb, try these three tricks: (1) Find the present participle and get the genitive. You should spot an English word right before the -is. (2) Find the 4th principle part; you’ll spot an English word there, too. (3) Try different prefixes until one hits on an English word. At least one of these three will always work, esp. if you combine them. Random examples: iacere (to lie). Tricks 1 and 3 get you the word adjacent. uti (to use). Tricks 1 and 2 get you abuse. referre (lots of meanings). Trick 1 gets you referent (reference, etc.), Trick 2 gets you relate, and Trick 3 gets you zillions of words (try ’em). Don’t know the meaning of a Latin word? If it’s a noun, it doesn’t matter. Just call it the same thing in English. You’ll figure it out from the context or you won’t, because you can’t. You generally can’t guess the meaning of nouns. Example: Ego tibi dabo hunc cadum = “I’ll give you this cadus.” What’s a cadus? It doesn’t matter — you got the rest of the sentence.

We haven’t even thought about rushing off to the Bahamas with your hard-earned money!\n\nThis time I’m going to shed a little light on a little something that makes it possible to render massive and densely populated worlds in real time: impostors.\n\nTo put it simply, an impostor is a flat polygon that looks like a more complex piece of geometry. They are often used as the last step in a set of levels of detail for an object. To make them look as convincing as possible, the textures applied to impostor polygons are usually rendered by the 3D engine rather than being created by artists. Reset has a deferred renderer so this is particularly simple: we just render a mesh into a tiny G-buffer and then use a special shader to splat copies of it onto the main G-buffer.\n\nSometimes impostor textures are updated dynamically based on the exact point of view. This is a fairly complicated system for a small team to develop, so we just render a fixed number of viewing angles for each mesh as a preprocessing step. At runtime all the data is available statically which makes rendering the impostors into the scene extremely simple and efficient. Transitions between meshes and impostors (as well as between meshes of different levels of detail) are handled with dithered cross-fading so there is no popping.\n\nThe island has about 100000 trees in total. In this particular view you can see a bunch of high detail tree meshes in the foreground as well as about 38000 tree impostors in the distance.\n\nAs development progresses the island will get populated by an increasing number of other objects and we will be able to use this system for them as well.It’s been a while since our last blog post, but it’s only because we’ve been hard at work, we swear!

Those raising the issue of foreign investment are exposed to accusations of racism, while \"the problems are not being solved.\"\n\n\"It's very convenient to brush this issue aside\"\n\nAcademics and activists for the local Chinese-Canadian community said lack of foreign ownership data has given elected officials a way out of dealing with critical Vancouver housing issues, including affordability and vacancy rates.\n\n“It’s very convenient for them to brush this issue aside,” explained FHK convenor Fenella Sung. “Data is key to get to the next step, but it’s not our role as citizens to get the data.”\n\nThe B.C. government has recently come under fire for its lack of data on foreign investment in Canadian homes, an issue that disproportionately affects Chinese-Canadians in Vancouver, says the group.\n\nThose comments were echoed by other panelists, including city councillor Adriane Carr, affordable housing activist Eveline Xia, the Vancouver Observer's editor-in-chief Sandy Garossino and UBC geography professor David Ley.\n\nThey demanded not only foreign investment data from the government, but accountability for how data is used.\n\nGovernments should base housing policy on census and survey information, said Ley, not statistics from the B.C. Real Estate Association, whose analysis recently informed Premier Christy Clark in her decision to reject the idea of a tax on luxury housing.\n\n\"If informed people tell you the same story a hundred times, that's more than anecdotal\"\n\n“If informed people tell you the same story a hundred times, that", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

I take pride in defying stereotypes by being somewhere that “my type” is not supposed be. I take pride in seeing the astonishment on someone’s face when I utter the words, “I go to Lehigh University.”\n\nSo why does the saying “All Lives Matter” irritate me? Well, the entire movement was created in response to Black Lives Matter. Let’s be real, there would be no All Lives Matter if there was no Black Lives Matter. It’s based on misconceptions of the true meaning of Black Lives Matter and simply some of society being uncomfortable with black people speaking out.\n\nUncomfortable.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is not a movement stating that blacks are superior to everyone else or blacks are the only ones experiencing struggle in this country. It’s a movement that is meant to shed light on the area of violence and systemic racism toward black people. According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, 82 percent of black voters think most black Americans receive unfair treatment from the police and just 19 percent of black voters think the justice system is fair to blacks and Hispanics. It’s not irrational to think this way after all the recent events that have happened involving unjustified killings of blacks by police officers.\n\nIn 2014, Arthur Chu, an American columnist, tweeted “Do people who change #BlackLivesMatter to #AllLivesMatter run thru a cancer fundraiser going ‘THERE ARE OTHER DISEASES TOO.'”\n\nWhen you say All Lives Matter, you are blindly undermining something that is meant to improve society. There’s a major issue to address in this country, and if you’re unaware, then your ignorance is disturbing.\n\nThis country still tends to struggle with change. All Lives Matter fits the comfort zone of some people because it ignores race. You can’t progress as a society if people refuse to step out of their comfort zones. Of course all lives matter. No one is disputing that, but black lives are being undervalued in this country and this must change. To those who believe the Black Live Matters movement is causing segregation all over again, you’re missing the point. In fact, you’re way off. This isn’t a war against other races — this is a war against injustice and a corrupt judicial system.\n\n", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 511}}

The photos went viral, with one post alone generating over 16,000 shares on Facebook.\n\nOthers have posted their photos on Twitter alongside the hashtag #IdidntJoin.\n\nAs the Obama administration prepares to present a draft resolution to lawmakers that is by no means “limited” in its scope and would in fact grease the skids for an open ended war, John Kerry and other State Department officials have signaled that Obama will simply ignore Congress if they vote no and launch the assault anyway.\n\nThis will do little to reassure a growing number of influential figures in the US military who are becoming increasingly recalcitrant about the United States becoming embroiled in yet another war in the Middle East.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that, “The Obama administration’s plan to launch a military strike against Syria is being received with serious reservations by many in the U.S. military, which is coping with the scars of two lengthy wars and a rapidly contracting budget, according to current and former officers.”\n\nRepublican Congressman Justin Amash also took to Twitter to state, “I’ve been hearing a lot from members of our Armed Forces. The message I consistently hear: Please vote no on military action against Syria.” Amash’s statement was followed by a series of tweets from military veterans who also expressed their opposition to the attack.\n\nBusiness Insider’s Paul Szoldra also spoke to “sources who are either veterans or currently on active duty in the military,” and asked them if they supported military escalation in Syria.\n\n“Most have responded with a resounding no,” writes Szoldra.\n\nHe quotes an active duty First Class Sergeant who states, “We are stretched thin, tired, and broke,” adding that the United States “(does not) need to be World Police.”\n\n“Our involvement in Syria is so dangerous on so many levels, and the 21st century American vet is more keen to this than anybody.

{"id": "sample_5_242", "config_id": 5, "prompt": "Prepubertal gonadectomy (PPG) is promoted for population control in cats, but concerns related to health and behavior still exist. From a behavioral point of view, in order for PPG to be an acceptable alternative for traditional-age gonadectomy (TAG), the occurrence of undesirable behavior should be unaffected by age at gonadectomy. The aims of this study were to investigate (1) whether the average number of (potentially) undesirable behaviors in shelter kittens during 24 months after adoption was associated with the age at gonadectomy and (2) whether social or environmental factors were related to the occurrence of commonly reported undesirable behaviors (inappropriate elimination, fearfulness, aggression, and destruction). Eight hundred healthy kittens between the estimated age of 8 and 12 weeks (0.7 and 1.4 kg) were recruited from animal shelters in Flanders, Belgium. Before adoption, kittens were randomly assigned to a PPG group (gonadectomy on assignment) and a TAG group (gonadectomy between 6 and 8 months of age). Online short- and long-term follow-ups were conducted using a 30-day diary immediately after adoption and surveys at 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after adoption. Mean number of potentially undesirable behaviors per day during the first month after adoption was not significantly different between PPG (1.48 ± 0.957) and TAG (1.39 ± 0.899) kittens (P = 0.32) and neither was the evolution of the mean number of potentially undesirable behaviors and undesirable behaviors during the long-term follow-up (P = 0.0946 and P = 0.10, respectively). The occurrence of inappropriate elimination, fearful behavior, non–play-related aggression, and destruction was associated with other social and environmental variables (e.g., the use of punishment by the owner and friendliness toward a stranger). In conclusion, this study in shelter cats did not demonstrate an effect of age at the time of gonadectomy on the mean number of (potentially) undesirable behaviors during 24 months after adoption. Other factors seem to play a more dominating role in the development of such behaviors.Prepubertal gonadectomy (PPG) is promoted for population control in cats, but concerns related to health and behavior still exist. From a behavioral point of view, in order for PPG to be an acceptable alternative for traditional-age gonadectomy (TAG), the occurrence of undesirable behavior should be unaffected by age at gonadectomy.

{"id": "sample_5_259", "config_id": 5, "prompt": "life things. Lesnar was more than just a big guy though; he was the full package. The dude was incredibly fast, strong and agile, and a great mat wrestler to boot. A lot of big guys impress you with their size, but not a lot can F-5 Rikishi or hit (well, loosely hit) a shooting star press. Lesnar is an NCAA wrestling champion and a pure athlete. He was awesome to watch because he could do just about anything. Every Survivor Series team needs a great power guy, an undefeatable monster. Why wouldn’t you want the best power guy of all time?\n\nKurt Angle\n\nAngle hit prominence around the time I stopped watching wrestling for a long time. Going back and watching his matches on Netflix, he makes me wish I hadn’t. Angle was the greatest pure wrestler to ever hit the business. He put on five-star matches with everybody. The guy is actually an Olympic gold medalist in men’s freestyle wrestling, and actually won with a broken neck. He’s as tough as they come, and he is the ultimate mat technician. Angle made wrestling look natural. Every throw and slam looked clean. Every hold looked like it was tearing the guy into pieces. He’s the technical piece of this team, and there isn’t a better technical piece in the world.\n\nShawn Michaels\n\nShawn is arguably the greatest wrestler there ever was. You’ll find him topping quite a few lists, and for good reason. I’ve never seen him put on a bad match. He used to captivate me as a kid. You could see the unbridled joy of years of hard work in his face when he won the strap from Bret Hart in overtime in the Iron Man Match. You saw the pain in his eyes when he was double-crossed by Sid or Kevin Nash or Triple H. Everything HBK (“The Heartbreak Kid”) did, you felt. He told the best in-ring story of anyone and was the fiercest competitor there was. Michaels can pull off incredible high spots, grapple with the best of them and perform dramatic comebacks. People will argue that Steve Austin’s Stone Cold Stunner was the ultimate finisher, but I can’t imagine how anything could top HBK’s Sweet Chin Music. He could hit it out of nowhere for a nail-biting finish", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Welcome!\n\nNow that you’ve taken the leap and invested in some crypto – let’s get one thing clear, right away… do you control your private keys? If you do, that’s perfect. If you don’t – then you don’t really control your new coins. That’s a big problem.\n\nWhoever controls your private keys controls your crypto. If that’s not YOU, that’s not good.\n\nDon’t be intimidated. If you need a quick refresher on what a public address or private key is, then take a second and read: Crypto 101: What’s an Address? Oh, go on. It’s a very quick read. We’ll continue momentarily…\n\nCrypto Exchanges\n\nIf you’re like most new crypto owners, then you bought your coins on an exchange such as Coinbase. That’s the simplest route and the most convenient option for the majority of people. However, the convenience of exchanges can lull you into being irresponsible after your purchase. Let’s examine…\n\nYou traded some government-issued money for some crypto. Your exchange then updated your account accordingly in their system to reflect this purchase. You can log on to their exchange at any time and your account reflects your ownership. You know what you own and so does your exchange.\n\nAll is well enough, right? NO (emphatically). All is not well – not at all.\n\nIf you logged in to your exchange tomorrow and their website didn’t show the correct amount of crypto in your account – what would you do? Sure, you’d call them – referencing screenshots, banks statements, etc etc. “No different from buying anything else,” you might think. Wrong. So wrong.\n\nImagine your phone call and paperwork couldn’t resolve the problem. Imagine it couldn’t resolve the problem because your exchange couldn’t resolve the problem. Imagine they had been hacked. Maybe it only affected your account, or maybe the entire exchange was compromised.\n\nIt could get even worse: imagine your exchange completely vanished. Maybe they closed up shop and took all the valuable crypto that their customers left on their system. Maybe the entire exchange was shut down by the government.

Brexit will present opportunities and risks for our economy and for the science and innovation that supports it. A regulatory regime that is well-crafted and tuned to our post-Brexit international research and trading relationships—both with Europe and globally—will be essential. The Government has an opportunity to do more to strengthen the links between the industrial strategy and Brexit as the Exit negotiations now get under way. That will be vitally important for keeping the Government's industrial strategy relevant and hooked-up to the opportunities presented by the evolving Brexit negotiations.\"\n\nEU researchers working and studying in the UK\n\nThe Committee also repeat their call for the Government to give a firm commitment to EU researchers working and studying in the UK that they will continue to have a secure position here post-Brexit.\n\nThe Government told the Committee previously that it could not give such a unilateral commitment but that a reciprocal deal on this was a high priority, and the Prime Minister repeated that position in her Article 50 statement on 29 March.\n\nGovernment's Autumn Statement pledge\n\nThe Committee welcomes the Government's Autumn Statement pledge of an additional £2 billion a year of science and research funding which, the Committee says, will be a valuable contribution to maintaining the country's world-leading science status and help maintain the UK as an attractive location for research.\n\nStephen Metcalfe MP, Chair of the Science and Technology Committee, said:\n\n\"The Government has significantly increased science funding, which will put us in a better position post-Brexit to attract skilled researchers and collaborative science projects. I want the Government to see that as an initial investment towards meeting a target—for the UK to be spending 3% of GDP on R&D—that our Committee has repeatedly pushed for.\"\n\n\"While it is too soon to know whether Brexit will end up bringing less or more inward science investment to the UK in the long-term, the Government should be ready to make good any net shortfall in the short-term with further funding for science.\"\n\nSTEM skills\n\nThe Committee also calls for the Government to complement its raft of initiatives to increase STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) skills, including the new further education T' level, by scaling-up existing local STEM-promoting initiatives.\n\nFurther education reforms aimed at raising STEM skills", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Even if people suffer or if wages fall, this is then absolutely necessary and is justified because falling wages do a good thing, produce a good thing, namely more jobs, which is not true.\n\nUnemployment is falling very slowly, but it's falling quite steadily, but it is not, so to say, the immediate result of the reduction of the social contributions to the poorer people or the reduction of the wages. It's mainly the result of Germany's huge export surplus, which cannot be copied by other countries.\n\nGermany has now a very low minimum wage. It's eight euros and a little bit, which is much too low given the productivity of Germany. If Madam Merkel would really be realistic and would not have her ideology of low wages producing jobs, she would increase the minimum wage. There would be no problem at all given the very high German productivity.\n\nThe Social Democrats and the Green Party were those in the beginning of the century who reduced the social contributions, who said we have to lower the contributions dramatically to make the people search for work and that will reduce unemployment. The Social Democrats have never distanced from their own mistakes and so there is no difference between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats on this.\n\nThe most probable outcome will be a continuation of the Grand Coalition, so we will go on for the next four years. And the poor people will not change the outcome of the election because they are four or five million people and many of them will not even go to the election, so that will not change anything.\n\nFlassbeck's remarks show that current German leadership actually continues to lower wages, not because this is a policy that helps towards the creation of jobs, but, essentially, because of its ideological devotion to the destructive neoliberalism.\n\nFurthermore, check out again Merkel's last sentence: \"This means that people who work the full day should not be reliant on welfare.\" Actually, Merkel is showing the policy that her party, or coalition, is about to implement in case she will get elected for another term. Next step according to the Greek experiment: the destruction of the welfare state, which has a long tradition in Germany.\n\nAs already described , German oligarchs promote another \"haircut\" of multiple dimensions across Europe. They proceed into a violent cut of salaries and pensions, trying to equalize them in a first phase with those of countries of the former Eastern bloc, and disolving the welfare state. Federalism means however, that the same policies", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

The Bitcoin Price Calculator allows you to check what the price would be should these predictions come true.\n\nIt seems easier to think of a market cap Bitcoin could reach as oppose to following the price. We can compare the market cap against the market cap of anything. This allows to put into more a more relative perspective the value that Bitcoin could potentially reach.\n\nHow does the Bitcoin Price Calculator work?\n\nThe Bitcoin Price Calculator allows us to take any market capitalization, at a particular point in time and see what the Bitcoin price would be. The given point in time would be a rough estimate based on the supply of Bitcoins’. There is a chart below which shows the estimated number of Bitcoins in a particular year. This is only an estimate as the supply could well vary from the date we have provided. Fortunately, the supply of coins does not affect the value of the coins a great deal.\n\nYou can compare the market cap against almost anything e.g.\n\nCommodoties Gold, Silver etc.\n\nCompanies Google, Facebook, Paypal etc.\n\nCountries\n\nThere Is conversions for both £ and $ and you can increase the market capitalization goes to a maximum of £/$2 trillion.

{"id": "sample_5_312", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " can hear a metallic ticking clicking sound coming from my new MacBook Pro i5 Unibody. It can be described as a glassy, high-pitched scraping sound. Sometimes, moving the computer or resting your hands or just touching it will cause the noise. Other times, the noise just happens of its own accord.\n\nBecause I have a SSD I knew it was not the hard drive I was hearing. I did wonder if I was the only person who had this problem, but I quickly found out there are a bunch of others who also complain about this clicking sound inside their MacBook Pro Unibody. There are even some who had record the sound of it or have made some YouTube video to show how it can be reproduced.\n\nDon’t even try to ask the Apple Genius Bar or the Apple Support Department, they do not even know what you are talking about, stating it is the CD laser head locking sensory system you are hearing.\n\nI had finally found a solution, and fixed the problem of this strange clicking sound in my MacBook Pro. All this thanks to Ten 1 Designer’s blog, the maker of the now famous pogo sketch stylus.\n\nHere’s how to solve the tick-click sound in your MacBook Pro Unibody:\n\nYou need to unscrew the back cover of your MacBook Pro and remove a little spring connector that touch (and scrape noisily) the bottom of the metallic casing when the computer heat up.\n\nTen 1 explain why removing this little connector will solve the problem (and it did) and also why it is not a crucial piece of equipment in your MacBook Pro:\n\nThe bottom cover of the MacBook Pro serves as a shield for radiated electromagnetic energy. A great shielding strategy is to find a huge piece of metal, and connect your circuit to that metal wherever possible. The MacBook Pro Unibody enclosure and bottom cover make a terrific shielding system. One of the connectors in this system touches the bottom plate right in the center where it flexes a lot. When the computer heats up, the metal pins in the connector scrape noisily against the cover and chassis. It makes you want to eat your hands.

It was situated on the Eurymedon River about 16 km inland from the Mediterranean Sea; it shared a border with, and was hostile to, Side.[2]\n\nSome scholars associate the city's name with \"Azatiwadaya\". The known city of that name was founded by Azatiwada of Quwê on his eastern frontier, at Karatepe.[3] According to later tradition, Aspendos was founded rather earlier by Greeks who may have come from Argos.\n\nThe wide range of its coinage throughout the ancient world indicates that, in the 5th century BC, Aspendos had become the most important city in Pamphylia. At that time, according to Thucydides, the Eurymedon River was navigable as far as Aspendos,[4] and the city derived great wealth from a trade in salt, oil and wool.\n\nAspendos did not play an important role in antiquity as a political force. Its political history during the colonisation period corresponded to the currents of the Pamphylian region. Within this trend, after the colonial period, it remained for a time under Lycian hegemony. In 546 BC it came under Persian domination. The fact that the city continued to mint coins in its own name, however, indicates that it had a great deal of freedom even under the Persians.\n\nCirca 465 BC Cimon led an Athenian navy against a Persian navy in the Battle of the Eurymedon, and destroyed it. Aspendos then became a member of the Delian League.[5]\n\nAqueduct of Aspendos\n\nThe Persians captured the city again in 411 BC and used it as a base. In 389 BC Thrasybulus of Athens, in an effort to regain some of the prestige that city had lost in the Peloponnesian Wars, anchored off the coast of Aspendos in an effort to secure its surrender. Hoping to avoid a new war, the people of Aspendos collected money among themselves and gave it to the commander, entreating him to retreat without causing any damage. Even though he took the money, he had his men trample all the crops in the", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

In fact, he quotes one source – a former Ukrainian official, Oleg Voloshin – as telling him that when Manafort worked as a political advisor to Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich:\n\nManafort was an advocate for US interests. So much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions [in Ukraine] was that he actually worked for the USA. … He supported Ukraine’s association with NATO and with the EU. He warned Yanukovich not to lock up [former Prime Minister Iuliia] Tymoshenko. “If it weren’t for Paul, Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier,” Voloshin told me.\n\nThis is pretty funny behaviour for a Kremlin agent, and Harding has to admit that, “It’s unclear to what extent, if any, Manafort was involved in supplying intelligence to Russia.” This doesn’t fit with the conclusion that Harding obviously wants readers to draw – that Manafort was a Kremlin agent, and so Trump must be too. So, he comes up with something else: some of Manafort’s associates in Ukraine “were rumoured to have links with Russian intelligence.” Note the use of the word “rumoured”. It’s not exactly convincing, but it’s good enough for Luke, who uses it to tell a story about one such associate, Konstantin Kilimnik. Harding recounts that he contacted Kilimnik by email to ask him about his relationship with Manafort. Kilimnik responds by telling him that the collusion accusations are “insane” and “gibberish”, and signs off his email with a bit of self-mockery: “Off to collect my paycheck at KGB. :))”\n\nAnd here’s where it gets interesting. For Harding thinks there’s something suspicious about Kilimnik’s answer. He writes:\n\nThe thing which gave me pause was Kilimnik’s use of smiley faces. True, Russians are big emoticon fans. But I’d seen something similar before. In 2013 the Russian diplomat in charge of political influence operations in London was named Sergey Nalobin. Nalobin had close links with Russian intelligence.

What matters is whether or not we make it happen for ourselves.\n\nThose of you that have taken the course or read Financial Sorcery know about Set Point theory already – what better way to shift that point than by doing this?\n\nThe degree to which people who are ostensibly dedicated to causing change in strange and subtle ways are often trapped by ideas of what they do and don’t deserve has always amazed me.\n\nFuck what you deserve or don’t deserve: just go get it because you want it.\n\nDon’t come up with some faux cosmic “it is my true will” justification; go for it just because you want it.\n\nDon’t invent some reason you “need” it. Just do it because you want it.\n\nIf there is some kind of karmic-rewards point system that monitors what shit people get based on their actions, trust that it is FAR too complicated for your slightly evolved monkey brain to figure out, and assume that if you want it, it’s ok to go for it.\n", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Children today don’t play actual physical games or participate in sports like running, jumping, cricket, hockey and football and so on as much as they play all these games on the X-box, iPad or the mobile phone.\n\nIt was different when those in their 30s and 40s were growing up; just a generation ago, games played often entailed vigorous physical movement and exercise, which is much more preferable than sitting on the couch all day long and playing a video game.\n\nHere are 11 Desi childhood games that today’s kids are unlikely to play:\n\n1. Carom\n\nPHOTO: DHAKA TRIBUNE\n\nAt one time, teenagers would play at carom ‘clubs’ specifically set up for this purpose, especially in Karachi and Lahore — you would have to get boric powder for the board and learn the intricacies of how to take as many ‘goatees‘ in one ‘baari‘.\n\n2.

You would also need a tennis ball and then play by making two teams.\n\n5. Dark Room\n\nPHOTO: ONLINE\n\nHow many of you remember playing this as a kid? This was basically hide-and-seek but adapted to playing in a room that was pitch dark.\n\n6.

But it fails horribly at resolving the second problem. Each campaign season finds itself marked by soundbites, shallow arguments, and opinions as opposed to facts, because these are the things that win elections. Rumors & misinformation roam free and can change the course of elections, as John Kerry, John McCain & Barack Obama can all tell you. Without any pressure to listen to expert testimony from both sides, voters are free to self-segregate themselves within their own individual echo chambers. It’s no surprise that the election process more closely resembles a PR campaign, as opposed to a fact finding mission.\n\nIt’s all truly unfortunate, given that a much better system is staring us right in the face.\n\nImagine during every election year, auditoriums packed full of jurors, convening across every state in the country. Jurors holding the greatest civic responsibility of all: electing our Congressmen and the President.\n\nImagine every candidate being tried in these auditoriums across the country. Their actions, campaign promises, voting records, public policy platform & general conduct… all scrutinized carefully in a courtroom presided over by a judge. Imagine them being grilled by opposing attorneys for every campaign promise they broke, for every campaign contribution they accepted from lobbyists, for every dollar they spent on wasteful government expenditures, and for every vote they cast in favor of special interests. Imagine experts from the fields of Foreign Policy, Healthcare, Fiscal Planning, Economics & National Security… all brought in to give testimony on the candidates’ positions & how viable their plans are.\n\nImagine a jury in every county, a hundred strong, randomly picked from the public to represent every section & segment of our society, displaying the full and complete diversity that is America. Imagine a jury, excused from work & school for a few weeks, attentively listening to all expert testimony, carefully considering all the facts & analysis presented, and meticulously deliberating over who they would like to have represent them in their state capitol and Washington DC.\n\nThat is the type of democracy that I would like to live in.\n\nWinston Churchill once famously remarked that “the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.” The quote is often invoked as an insult against the average Joe, but I don’t", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) this week in a letter urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to closely scrutinize any promised benefits of the merger. The lawmakers warned the fusion of the firms would be a “troubling backward step” for public policy.\n\nConyers, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of the merger in Congress, said he appreciates the fact AT&T is the only unionized wireless carrier, but that he still believes the DOJ and the FCC must reject the proposal to protect consumers.\n\nAn AT&T spokesman said the firm is preparing new economic and engineering models to provide greater detail on the promised benefits of the deal, specifically on how combining the two networks will increase service and network capacity for customers while saving on costs.\n\n“The facts also demonstrate that the consumer and public interest benefits are enormous,” said AT&T general counsel Wayne Watts. “These include better service in the form of fewer dropped calls, faster speeds and a better overall customer experience, more mobile broadband access for more Americans.”\n\nThe FCC said the new submissions are expected to be complex, so the agency has stopped the 180-day clock on the review until it has had time to look over the additional evidence. The delay is not expected to last more than a month or to slow down the review process significantly.\n\n“Because this information, which we will submit next week, is detailed, we are not surprised that the FCC will take the time it needs to thoroughly understand our submission,” AT&T told The Hill in a statement. “We do not expect this will adversely impact the timeframe for approval of our transaction.”\n\nThe FCC and the DOJ are both reviewing the deal. Justice can sue to block it under the Clayton Antitrust Act, while the FCC can launch an administrative proceeding if it decides the merger is contrary to the public interest. The FCC can also approve the merger outright or with conditions, such as those attached to the NBC Universal-Comcast merger last year.\n\nOpponents argue there aren", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

That way, the builder can meet with the family and can take precise measurements of the chair or equipment. Since every wheelchair is different, it is important to do this to make sure the costume fits properly for Halloween. We would love to build a costume for every family that contacts us. However, if we are unable to locate a Custom Costume Builder in their area, we will still work with the family to help produce what we can from a distance. Some costume parts can easily be built with simple measurements provided by the family and then shipped to the family. Others, we may have to be more creative. It all depends on the costume that the child would like.\n\nAdditional costume designs for walkers and wheelchairs.\n\nOur first Custom Costume for Halloween 2015\n\nFor Halloween this year, we already have a 5 year old girl in a wheelchair who is very interested in dressing up as R2-D2. Her whole family is dressing up as “Star Wars” characters and we want to make sure that her costume will make for an awesome night. Here is an early concept drawing of that costume.\n\nR2D2 Costume design\n\nHow many kids will get a costume from Walkin’ & Rollin’ Costumes?\n\nThis year our goal is to build wheelchair costumes for 5 kids in time for Halloween 2015. But the number of children we can build for in the future is only limited by the funds we're able to raise and the number of Custom Costume Builders we can locate. So please pledge! We hope to eventually have a full network of Custom Costume Builders around the nation so we can create these awesome costumes for every child with special needs equipment, and ALWAYS, make them free of charge to the family.\n\nBelle gown that goes around the walker to hide it with the exception of the handles.\n\nThe Best Halloween for these kids.\n\nBeing in a wheelchair is very tough, especially for a child who just wants to run and play with their friends.

Many have been stopped for regular maintenance, during which utilities are conducting stress tests.\n\nThe accident, the most serious since the explosion and fire at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986, led to widespread contamination, prompted mass evacuations, caused upheaval throughout the nuclear industry and forced the government to review its overall energy policy.\n\nClearing the stress tests against extreme events — like the March 11 disaster — is a necessary hurdle to clear for the restart of the two reactors run by the Kansai Electric Power Co. at the Ohi plant in western Japan.\n\nThe Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) set no date for the review to be completed.\n\n“We will do our homework after today’s hearing, discuss by ourselves and decide on it when appropriate,” Tomoya Ichimura, director of NISA’s nuclear safety regulatory standard division, told reporters after a meeting of a panel of experts.\n\nSome improvements had already been introduced at the two 1,180 megawatt reactors after computer-simulated test results suggested some equipment and other factors needed improvement.\n\nThe timing of the watchdog’s first such stress test approval is being carefully watched. Industry and government officials are keen to see some reactors brought back on stream soon to avoid a potentially serious power crunch in the summer.\n\nOnce the tests are completed, they must be validated by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan and approved by four cabinet ministers, including Trade Minister Yukio Edano and Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.\n\nApproval must then be forthcoming from local authorities hosting nuclear power plants. Although agreement is not required by law, ministers are mindful of public concerns about safety.\n\nTrade minister Edano, who holds the energy portfolio, said this week he had not set deadlines to resume operations at nuclear reactors after a media report said the government aimed to restart the two Ohi reactors around April.\n\nIchimura on Wednesday declined to say when NISA will compile its final report or if the panel of experts will talk about the Ohi reactors again when they next meet on February 20.\n\nA new atomic safety regulator under the auspices of the environment ministry is set to replace NISA in April in a move to separate the regulatory role from the trade ministry, which also promotes", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Once the workers’ harnesses are secured, the men lean out over the upper deck to reach the crank that sends the flags up or down.\n\n“Obviously these guys don’t have a fear of heights,” said Doug Behar, the Yankees’ vice president of stadium operations. “I don’t love being up high. I like to look at the standings from second base, not up on the roof.”\n\nSome days, the elements come into play. There is wind and rain, which sometimes complicate matters by wrapping the flags around the rope, and there is a menacing peregrine falcon that has a favorite perch on an antenna atop the roof in left field. But the reward is sublime: a 360-degree view of the city and a platform so high it renders the hustle and flow of the South Bronx and Harlem all but silent.\n\n“This is an artist’s dream to be up here,” Thomas said Friday, a sunny, springlike day that offered a clear view of the Midtown skyline. “If you can paint, you can see anything.”\n\nThomas, 59, has worked for the Yankees since 1989. Having grown up across the river at 154th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, he remembers peeking out his bedroom window when his mother would ask him what time it was: He had a clear view of the Longines clock sign that stood for years outside the old Yankee Stadium.\n\nLong before information was available with the click of a phone button, ballparks had ways to disseminate information — be it the time of day or whether the home team had won or lost. Before lights were installed at Wrigley Field, a W or L flag was raised near the scoreboard so that people passing by on the elevated train would know the Cubs’ result.

Weisberg filed incorporation papers with the state June 2.\n\nIn the invitation to the July 21 dinner at El Gaucho, Weisberg said he has invited Jack Kervorkian, the Michigan pathologist who provided the drugs and the means for terminally ill people to kill themselves and served a prison sentence for his actions.\n\nOn the website for End of Life Consultants, Weisberg said he has obtained a Portland property that he calls \"The Dignity House\" where his patients under the Death With Dignity law can receive the medicine and die there. The website promises an address and photos next month.\n\nOfficials at nonprofit organizations that work with patients under Oregon's assisted-suicide law expressed surprise at the little information they could glean about Weisberg's proposal. The doctor has not spoken with anyone at the Death With Dignity National Center or Compassion & Choices of Oregon. Last year, doctors helped 59 people to die in Oregon under the law.\n\n\"Never heard of him,\" said George Eighmey, executive director of Compassion & Choices of Oregon, which assists more than 90 percent of Oregonians who die under the law. Eighmey said the only place akin to what Weisberg proposes is Dignitas in Switzerland.\n\nAnd Eighmey said he does not believe Weisberg's services would be necessary anyway.\n\n\"Ninety-eight percent of the people who receive the medicine under the Death With Dignity Act take the medicine at home,\" he said. \"It's going to be highly unlikely that people are going to use his service. And we don't charge. He charges $5,000.\"\n\nThe website lists a host of fees, including a mandatory $600 for the stay at Dignity House and a mandatory $600 for \"End of Life Camera,\" which will record the patient's last hours.\n\nOptional fees include $400 for End of Life Catering, $400 for End of Life Security – a consultation with a \"certified security agent\" – $400 for linens and flowers from Weisberg's home garden and $400 for End of Life Music, which promises two 100-minute sets of piano music that \"will be magical.\"\n\nWeisberg, 37, is a solo practitioner with an office in Northwest Portland.

If we as a society are more accepting of people of all sizes, we free each other up to instead focus on our actual health.\n\nThe implication that feeling unconfident or unbeautiful at certain sizes inspires better health is the exact opposite of what tends to actually happen.\n\nTomiyama and Mann conducted a study in which they posed two sets of questions to different subject groups. One set of questions was designed to make the subjects aware of weight stigma while the control questions asked about ecofriendly behaviors.\n\nAfter subjects answered their questions, researchers presented them with a variety of foods and gave them permission to eat whatever and however much they would like. The people who had just responded to questions about weight stigma consumed significantly higher amounts of sugar and calories than those who answered neutral questions.\n\nTheir findings mirror our clinical observations and experiences. People often believe that self-dissatisfaction will somehow inspire better health, when in reality the individuals who love and accept themselves as they are tend to be the ones motivated to take better care of themselves.\n\nCorrelation is not synonymous with causation.\n\nThe questioner ended her inquiry with, “the very real facts that they do cause legitimate health concerns.” The context suggests that she misspoke when she used the word “they” and was actually referring to obesity.\n\nIf that presumption is indeed correct, then she is confusing correlation and causation. Earlier this month, I watched a fireworks display one evening and then a parade the next morning. Did the fireworks cause the parade, or did these events occur in close proximity to each other due to another factor, say, Independence Day?\n\nSimilarly, when we consider the diseases linked to obesity, we must remember that correlation does not equal causation. The link, in other words, might not be a causal relationship, but rather an association due to other factors. Many examples exist, but for the sake of brevity, consider just one: stress. Cardiovascular disease, which is often blamed on obesity, is also associated with life stress.\n\nIf you are not obese yourself, do your best to put yourself in those shoes for a moment: You live in a society where the government has declared war on your body size; where fat hate and bullying are prevalent online and in real life; where you might fear going to the doctor because you are more likely to receive a judgmental directive to lose weight rather than an actual evidence-based medical intervention; where commercials, memes,", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

These include the anxiety of artistic creation, the fear of love and the dread of its loss, and the desperate sense that your life is rushing by faster than you can make sense of it. A sad story, yes, but fittingly for a movie bristling with paradoxes and conundrums, also extremely funny.\n\nNothing in Mr. Kaufman’s film happens as you might expect it to, even if his previous work had conditioned you to expect surprises. Cannes, meanwhile, has a way of disappointing expectations even as it confirms them. After last year’s robust 60th-anniversary edition of the festival, which yielded so many great movies (and quite a few sales), this one feels like a bit of a letdown.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt’s not that the films are bad, but rather that many of the directors in competition have, with their previous work, set such a high standard. Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, with two Palmes d’Or already on their résumés, arrived this year with “Le Silence de Lorna,” an engrossing movie about the moral struggle of a young Albanian immigrant in Belgium. It’s very good. Not a masterpiece, though, which is what the Dardenne brothers have conditioned us to expect.\n\nAnd many of us were anticipating masterpieces from the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan and from the Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel, whose second feature, “The Holy Girl,” was a discovery of the 2004 festival.

Later in practice, during passing drills, Cromartie jawed at Stephen Hill after holding the rookie receiver. Ryan had issued a warning to his team, dangling the gassers as punishment, and the following play proved to be the final straw.\n\nCromartie, a seven-year veteran, delivered what Ryan considered an inappropriate hit on tight end Dustin Keller.\n\n\"I thought 'Cro' should have backed off and not hit Dustin,\" Ryan said. \"He's trying to be physical and pick his play up. We always talk about developing habits. But in that situation, that’s your teammate. You don’t want to do it. I thought 'Cro' was wrong in that situation.\"\n\nCromartie declined to speak to reporters today, loudly expressing his disdain for the media when approached by a member of the team's public relations staff.\n\nThe practice field became stunningly quiet as the players retreated to the sideline for the gassers. When the sprints were complete -- Tim Tebow, for what it's worth, out-ran all his teammates -- Ryan huddled his team at midfield.\n\nHe urged his players to be smart, to play physical but yet protect each other. When Ryan was done with his speech, quarterback Mark Sanchez stepped in to echo Ryan's message.\n\nIt was the first time Ryan, entering his fourth season as the Jets head coach, has ordered his team to run gassers.\n\n\"I just wanted them to know how serious I am about it,\" Ryan said. \"And I also wanted to run them until I was tired.\"\n\nRyan has resolved not to lose \"the pulse\" of the team this year, as he admitted happened in 2011, and to stay on top of any potential tension in his locker room. But he bristled at the reference to last year, and said he's always tried to be in control and create a positive culture as the Jets head coach.\n\nThe past aside, that was certainly what Ryan did on the practice field today.\n\n\"I know what my job is. My job is to get this team ready to go,\" Ryan said. \"And be the team that I envisioned having. We are going to, and that’s it.\"\n\nMany of Ryan's players said his message got through loud and clear.\n\n\"I don’", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

In the fact sections of the complaint, plaintiff carefully refrains from alleging that the owners of the IP address – i.e., the named defendants – are the ones who utilized the internet access to download the copyrighted material. Rather, plaintiff alleges that the IP address assigned to each defendant “was observed infringing Plaintiff’s motion picture” ... and that each named defendant either (a) downloaded the BitTorrent “client” application and used it to download and share the copyrighted material or (b) permitted, facilitated, or promoted the use of their internet connections by others to download and share the copyrighted material .... Pursuant to plaintiff’s allegations, a particular defendant may have directly and intentionally stolen plaintiff’s copyrighted material, or she may simply have “facilitated” unauthorized copying by purchasing an internet connection which an unidentified third party utilized to download “Elf-Man.” Plaintiff provides no factual allegations that make one scenario more likely than the other: both are merely possible given the alternative allegations of the complaint.\n\n[....] The critical defect in this case is not the alternative pleading of claims of direct, contributory, and indirect infringement. Rather, the problem arises from the alternative pleading of the facts that are supposed to support those claims. The effect of the two “or” conjunctions means that plaintiff has actually alleged no more than that the named defendants purchased internet access and failed to ensure that others did not use that access to download copyrighted material.\n\nA few courts have noted similar things, but Fight Copyright Trolls and TorrentFreak both recently covered an interesting district court ruling out of Seattle, where Judge Robert Lansik noted that the producers of the movie Elf Man failed to state a claim for relief, since the only evidence they had was an IP address -- which wasn't enough to actually implicate any particular person in copyright infringement.Of course, we've seen plenty of copyright holders directly allege that failure of a internet account holder to stop infringement is somehow a violation of the law itself, but that's not what the law says at all. Here, the judge is correctly noting that make a huge inference from just the IP address to having enough for a lawsuit makes the plaintiff's claim not enough to move forward.

{"id": "sample_5_392", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " the Joint Center for Housing Studies, the median monthly rent was more than $1,000. Fewer than 5 percent of rental units rented for less than $400 and fewer than 34 percent for less than $800.\n\nNor has social policy kept up. Low-income renters in the U.S. are helped by a patchwork of programs. These include the oldest program, public housing, and the more recent fashion of housing-choice vouchers. There are even USDA subsidies for some renters. Meanwhile, the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) subsidizes landlords to maintain and develop low-income housing.\n\nBut it is clear from the statistics that these programs are falling far short of ensuring affordable housing for Americans in the proliferating low-wage economy. In 2011, only 4.6 million renters benefited from rental assistance, while 19.3 million households were eligible.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAnd then there was the bipartisan policy in the 1990s and 2000s of encouraging home ownership rather than renting — including efforts to peddle mortgages to those known as NINJAs — no incomes, no jobs and no assets. While that wasn’t the sole cause of the financial crisis, its contributing role should force us to reconsider the American conviction that homeowners are more virtuous and make better citizens than renters. Other countries, including Germany, prosper with far more renters rather than homeowners — or rather “homedebtors.”\n\nIf housing expenditures for the bottom three quintiles were reduced to the classic standard of 30 percent — roughly what the richest two quintiles spend — then the discretionary incomes of low-income renters that could be spent on other things like food, transportation, health care and recreation could be increased — by nearly 10 percent of their incomes, in the case of the poorest Americans.\n\nIf we are serious about having a national conversation about inequality, the issue of housing affordability must be part of it. While incentives to build more affordable units may be part of the solution, some degree of government assistance may always be necessary, given the proliferation of jobs that would pay low wages even with a somewhat higher minimum wage.\n\nMany academic economists believe that means-tested programs targeted to the poor are more efficient than universal social programs that chiefly benefit the middle class but incidentally (and disproportionately) benefit the poor. But most academic economists are fools. They live in a fantasy world without selfish voters.

{"id": "sample_5_401", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " eight threatened species, all plants, are entirely confined to cities. For example, the Nielsen Park she-oak is found only within metropolitan Sydney, and the fringed spider-orchid only in a rapidly developing part of Melbourne.\n\nEach Australian city contains a different suite of threatened species. About half of the species, or 258, are found in only one city each. But all 99 of the cities are known or likely to be home to at least one threatened animal, and 88 of them are known or likely to harbor threatened plants. Sydney contains the most threatened species, with 124 found there.\n\nEven more striking, the researchers found that acre for acre, urban areas contain more threatened species than do non-urban areas, leading them to dub cities “hotspots” for threatened species.\n\nAs an extra test of this finding, the researchers also created “dummy” cities equivalent in area and in the same bioregion as each of the 99 real cities. True cities contain more threatened species than dummy cities, they found.\n\nIn some ways this is no surprise. Cities tend to be located in areas of high biodiversity, because humans just like other living things know a promising patch of habitat when they see one. And once urbanization gets going, of course, it tends to put the squeeze on wild plants and animals.\n\nBut the findings also suggest that with a little more care and consideration cities could make a major contribution to conservation. Urban areas commonly contain patches of native habitat interspersed with development, after all. Moreover, landscapes planted and maintained by humans can help certain species through lean times of the year.\n\nEven so, policymakers often consider urban habitat degraded and insignificant, the researchers note, and therefore permit development that further erodes habitat for threatened species, bit by little bit. So the assumption that cities don’t matter not only means missed opportunities for conservation, but paradoxically, could itself be a threat to endangered species survival. – Sarah DeWeerdt | January 5, 2016\n\nSource: Ives C.D. et al. “Cities are hotspots for threatened species.” Global Ecology and Biogeography DOI: 10.1111/geb.12404\n\nHeader image: Carnaby’s black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris), photographed in a suburb of Perth, Australia.

They wouldn’t let us tell the jury I was sick, or that I was a doctor,” Fry said. “They wouldn’t allow that I was helping sick patients.\n\n“Ironically, two years before the raid, local authorities asked me to tell them who of my patients were ‘really’ sick, and who wasn’t.

Her grandfather, Dr. Francis Marion Pottenger, played a part in curing tuberculosis in the early 1900s and her grandmother studied under Carl Jung in the 1950s. Her mother was also a physician.\n\n“Cannabis is proven medicine,” Fry said. “Why would the state of California create laws based on what the people want, and then allow the federal government to override them? I had cancer; we were growing medicine.

I know he's wrong,\" Ali continued, adding that \"the best defense of defamation is the truth.\"\n\nAli said Bolling's intent to intimidate him is clear because Bolling filed the lawsuit against him personally, not against his company that has a multibillion-dollar parent.\n\n\"It's really important to note, Brian, that he's suing me personally for $50 million. He did not include HuffPost, which is owned by Verizon, in this lawsuit. If he wants $50 million, if you feel that you've been aggrieved and you deserve damages, you go after the multibillion-dollar conglomerate, not an individual reporter,\" Ali told Stelter.\n\nAli said he welcomes the opportunity to depose the Fox News host, saying he hopes his case will serve as an example to other journalists should they face similar legal actions.\n\n\"I relish the opportunity to see and being deposed and to stand up for not only my First Amendment rights, the First Amendment Rights of many reporters who messaged me after this came out, saying that they would be scared by this kind of action,\" Ali said.\n\n\"And, you know, I'm not trying to turn myself into a representative for the media here, but I feel like I have to really fight this because of other reporters who would be frightened by this kind of action,\" he added.\n\nAli has demanded Bolling dismiss his lawsuit over a report, published earlier this month on HuffPost, detailing allegations that the host sent lewd photos of male genitalia to two female coworkers", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

When your team is being routed and you currently have an A+, just fall back and regroup. It will keep your killzone cleaner. Killing bots at the very front while your entire team is respawning is asking to lose money. Rottenberg is a prime example of this.\n\n2. If you kill something in a weird place and can't grab the money, tell your Scout/Spy where it is. They are not psychic, and you're wasting their time and weakening your entire team by making them look all over for it.\n\n3. Medics, over-heal your scouts. If the scout is dead near you and you can spare 2 seconds, revive them!\n\n4. A+ is a team effort. If you really want it, HELP PICK UP MONEY.\n\nRULES OF HELPING WITH MONEY:\n\n1. If you kill a robot away from the scout, PICK UP THE CASH\n\n2. If your Scout/Spy/Money-person is dead, PICK UP THE CASH\n\n3. Leave giant piles of easy-to-grab cash for the scout. He needs the overheal.\n\n4. Pick up the little cash piles for the scout unless they're somewhere obvious and convenient. The more you make your scout/spy hustle all over the map over chump change, the less milking/marking and dead giants you get.\n\n5. The closer you get to the end of the wave, the more you should help with money to maintain the A+. In the last 20% of a wave, everyone should be watching the cash situation very closely as not to waste the Scout's efforts.\n\n6. If you have a money Spy, grab all the cash you can. One of the reasons Spy can be so difficult to play is because teammates are braindead about cash.\n\n7. Once the wave ends, don't just run straight back to the upgrade shop if there's still money missing. Help look for it!\n\nSo there you go.

{"id": "sample_5_415", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " attributed to the rise in oil prices. If this rise is factored out (as is done in the so-called current cost of supplies figures), Shell’s profits were $7.8 billion and BP’s were $6.6 billion. That is, at least $2 billion in profit for the two companies can be attributed solely to the recent rise in oil prices.\n\nAnalysts expect the profits for Exxon Mobil, the largest private energy company, to soar to $11.2 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 22 percent over 2007. If the company’s profits exceed expectations, however, it could beat its fourth quarter profits from 2007 of $11.66 billion—the record for a US company.\n\nOf course, the top executives and investors will benefit enormously from these windfalls. Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson received an 18 percent raise in 2007, pulling in $21.7 million. The oil companies will also give back billions to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.\n\nThe news from Shell and BP came as a surprise to analysts, who have been concerned about profit troubles in the refinery component of production, which transforms crude oil into useable products like gasoline and diesel. Giants like Shell and BP, and US companies Exxon and Chevron, are vertically integrated, including in their operations both oil extraction and refining.\n\nIn fact, independent refinery operations are fairing poorly, which could indicate that gasoline prices will continue their upward march over the next several weeks as refiners struggle to raise their own profits. Valero Energy, a refiner, reported a 77 percent drop in first quarter net income on Tuesday, complaining that it had been unable to shift all of its increased costs (from purchasing crude oil) onto consumers.\n\nAccording to a report in the Wall Street Journal, “While the price of gasoline has been rising at the pump, those increases have so far been modest in comparison to oil. In a bid to save their bottom lines, companies operating refineries, especially on the West Coast, are reducing their output. That would likely drive fuel prices higher.”\n\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that some of California’s refineries “have had problems returning to full production following their usual winter-spring overhauls,” and that this has contributed to the near-$4 a gallon price of gasoline in that state. There are indications that refiners have in the past artificially manipulated capacity and downtime in order to influence prices.\n\nThe", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It will land in the Timeline in whichever track is the lowest of those that are selected. Okay, weird, but no biggie, and yes, you can select multiple video tracks, although only one will be used. (The selected tracks are the ones in the wider of those 2 columns at the head of the Timeline.) Just ignore the source track indicators (the V, A1, etc.). I know what you’re thinking. It would be easier just to slide those into place, rather than all the clicking it takes to select your target track and unselect the others, but the source track target makes no difference in this operation.\n\nOf course, you’re a pro. So you want to learn the keyboard commands as quickly as possible. Try the same exact thing, only this time, press the period key. That’s the overwrite shortcut. At this point, any number of surprising things can occur. One possibility is that nothing will happen. That’s because you have to slide the source track indicator to your target track AND make sure the track is selected in the next column. Forget the whole lowest selected track thing. That no longer applies.\n\nIt used to be even worse. Try repeating those same steps in CS5.5 using the Insert button instead of the associated keyboard shortcut, and you’ll get a third set of entirely distinct behaviors.\n\nThinking this was still too simple, Adobe threw in “sync lock” for good measure. It’s kind of like a reverse track lock, which is a nice idea. The supposed function is to push all sync locked tracks down the Timeline after an insert edit and keep the others in place, but turn it off for a track and you’ll find it makes no difference — unless you also deselect the track. Be sure to select at least one of the tracks that is supposed to move as well.\n\nI won’t even get into more insert edit nonsense.\n\nFinally, just as a final fuck you, it’s actually possible to click on the source track indicators (as opposed to sliding them) and select or deselect them, much like the target tracks.

{"id": "sample_5_421", "config_id": 5, "prompt": "1039]\n\nStep 1: How To Bleach Your Hair\n\nThe first step is bleaching your hair. If you have anything but light blonde hair, you absolutely need to bleach it if you want the pastel color to actually be pastel. If you have already blonde hair, skip this step. When choosing your bleaching product, it’s important to go for 30 volume. Anything under that is too weak for achieving pastel hair, and anything over that is too strong for safety — bleach can fry your hair, so be very careful! I recommend this nifty Manic Panic bleaching kit, which also contains gloves, a brush, and a mixing bowl. Tip: If you have very thick or long hair, you WILL need 2 boxes! It ends up going a bit over budget, but it’s well worth it! The first time I bleached my hair, I had to pause the job mid-bleaching and ask my friend to kindly go buy another box for me. Get two if you’re unsure!\n\nMake sure your hair hasn’t been washed for a few days before bleaching. Bleach is harsh on your scalp, and the oils will help protect it.\n\nIf it’s your first time, have someone else help you and bleach your hair for you. Bleaching hair is tricky. Be safe!\n\nFollow the instructions on the packaging. A strand test is a very good idea!\n\nIf your hair still isn’t light enough after bleaching, consider a white toner. If you want pastel blue hair, your hair has to be a very white blonde. Any yellow in your hair and the blue dye will turn green!\n\nStep 2: How to Get Pastel Hair\n\nThere is no “pastel hair dye”. Instead, you will have to mix regular colored hair dye with conditioner. Start by squirting the conditioner in a mixing bowl: add the amount you think will cover your entire hair. Add a very small amount of hair dye and mix it well. Keep adding dye (or conditioner if you mess up) until you reach the perfect pastel color you want.

They sold cookies.\n\nThen they read the signs: “Sick toys for children make for a sick society.”\n\nThat May, Nabisco had attempted to diversify by purchasing Aurora Company, the West Hempstead, New York model kit maker best known for their plastic kits of Frankenstein’s monster, the Wolf Man, and other horror film icons. The cheap plastic toys came in pieces and could be glued together and painted.\n\nUnknown to Nabisco, Aurora had recently branched out and begun offering entire model kit dioramas. Instead of a single figure, consumers could buy detailed “sets” for their monsters to interact with. There was a guillotine, a razor-sharp pendulum, and a laboratory; a female protagonist, referred to in the copy as “the Victim,” was scantily-clad and ready to be dismembered, beheaded, or trapped in a spiked cage. Kids could also opt to have Vampirella, the top-heavy villain licensed from Warren Publishing, operate the winch and pulley while her plastic captive was shackled to a table.\n\nEach kit also contained a comic, which instructed builders on how to assemble the torture scenes for maximum enjoyment. A narrator named Dr. Deadly seemed to opine on the appeal of the Victim once she was fully assembled. “Now that you’ve gotten her all together, I think I like the other way. In pieces … yesssss.”\n\nIn addition to Fig Newtons, Nabisco realized it had also been peddling tiny torture racks.\n\nZ1DO4U via YouTube\n\nSince its inception in 1952, Aurora had seen enormous success by exploring the horror genre. As television came into prominence and late movies screened the classic Universal monster films of the 1930s, a new generation of monster buffs had been nourished. Kits featuring Dracula, the Mummy, and even Godzilla were cheap to produce and sell. (Many models retailed for just 98 cents.) Having the consumer construct them with contact cement and model paint gave them a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAurora held contests for custom kits, highlighting winners in monster magazines.

The pawnbroker symbol has been in use at least since the medieval period in Europe. It is still used by pawnbrokers all around the world today. There are differing theories proposing how these three spheres came to represent pawn shops and pawnbroking.\n\nHouse of Lombard\n\nAlthough pawnbroking and pawn shops have existed for thousands of years, pawnbroking became synonymous with the Italian province of Lombardy, which is located in Northern Italy. Bankers in this province built up the success of their businesses using the pawnbroking business-model, which later acquired the name, Lombard banking. Lombard merchants are said to have hung three golden spheres outside their homes. It is thought that the golden spheres originally represented three gold coins, which later were redesigned as spheres to attract more attention.\n\nThe Medici\n\nThree circles make up the family crest of the famous (and sometimes infamous) Medici family. The Medici family were affluent bankers who were widely known throughout Europe as influential patrons of the arts. With deep pockets, the family held sway with politicians, lawmakers and church leaders. As the Medici family’s success in finance and money-lending increased, other families assimilated the three circles into their coat of arms. Before long, the three circles became synonymous with money-lending and banking.\n\nSt. Nicholas of Myra\n\nSaint Nicholas of Myra was a 4th century Greek Bishop and is the patron saint of pawnbroking. Tales abound recounting his generosity to the poor. According to a well-known tale, a poor man in his town had three daughters but was not able to afford an adequate dowry for them to be married. Without a dowry, they would not be able to fetch husbands and, as such, would most likely have to become prostitutes. St. Nicholas, under cover of night, dropped a sack filled with gold coins into each daughter’s window, effectively rescuing them from a life of misery. The three bags of gold came to represent the three gold spheres used by pawnbrokers on their store fronts. Saint Nicholas day is December 6th, which is also National Pawnbrokers Day.The symbol for pawnbroking is three gold spheres suspended from a bar.

If you’ve always wanted to get past second base with Siri, this app may be your dream come true.\n\nThe most realistic sex dolls money can buy – Forget blow-up dolls, a company called Sinthetics is now offering “life size, fully articulated, anatomically correct” sex dolls (or “manikins” as the company calls them). These are probably the most life-like sex dolls money can buy (check out some sample images on the Sinthetics website), and they can be completely customized to your personal likes and (if applicable) fetishes. Breasts and penises come in all sizes, you can say where you want hair and where you don’t, and you can even give your new friend things like tattoos, piercings, and tan lines. Oh, and elf ears and monster eyes are options too. Manikins start at $5,500, but if you want a completely custom body or head, expect to spend quite a bit more.\n\nPleasure your partner (or yourself) with remote-controlled underwear – blueMotion, developed by OhMiBod, is a set of vibrating panties that you can control from your smartphone via a Bluetooth connection.

But the polarization of income in the U.S., accompanied by the creation of mostly low-paying jobs, has made that prudent standard impossible for a growing number of Americans to meet.\n\nThe problem was worsened, but not caused, by the Great Recession. Even before the economic downturn, according to Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, the share of “cost-burdened” renters shelling out more than 30 percent of their pre-tax income to landlords was rising until nearly half of all renters were cost-burdened. The ratio of renters who pay more than 30 percent of their incomes in housing costs has risen from 1 in 4 in 1960 to 1 in 3 in 1980 to 1 in 2 today.\n\nNeither private supply nor public subsidies have compensated for rising renter stress. Let’s start with the supply side. To spend 30 percent or less of a $15,000 income, a renter would have to spend no more than $375 a month on shelter. But in 2011, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies, the median monthly rent was more than $1,000. Fewer than 5 percent of rental units rented for less than $400 and fewer than 34 percent for less than $800.\n\nNor has social policy kept up. Low-income renters in the U.S. are helped by a patchwork of programs. These include the oldest program, public housing, and the more recent fashion of housing-choice vouchers. There are even USDA subsidies for some renters.

The problem is, the drug has already been approved.\n\nDeveloped by Sarepta Therapeutics, the drug is the first to be approved for the rare genetic disease which leads to a steady erosion and wasting of muscles that eventually consigns boys to wheelchairs and an early grave. STAT reports that Duchenne was approved in spite of often rancorous disagreement out of the limelight among top FDA officials regarding the extent that the drug actually helps patients.\n\nCentral to the infighting was a 2013 study into whether the drug was able to produce levels of a protein called dystrophin in sufficient amounts. Without that protein, muscle fibers deteriorate and voluntary movement disappears.\n\nThe study, which of course was funded by the drug maker and co-authored by four of the pharmaceutical’s employees, found that the medicine produced enough dystrophin and allowed affected boys some ability to walk.\n\nBut Califf sided with a pair of FDA officials who also believe that the study, which was published in the journal Annals of Neurology, should be pulled.\n\n“The publication, now known to be misleading, should probably be retracted by its authors,” Califf wrote in a memo, in which he touched on the internal dispute within his agency.\n\n“In view of the scientific deficiencies identified in this analysis, I believe it would be appropriate to initiate a dialogue that would lead to a formal correction or retraction (as appropriate) of the published report,” the agency chief added in a footnote.\n\nThe disagreement was initiated in large part by various moves made by Dr. Janet Woodcock, the controversial manager of the FDA’s drug review division, who pushed hard for the approval of the Sarepta drug.\n\nThough she reportedly had concerns about the study, she also argued with other agency officials who did not agree with her decision to approve the drug, as well the manner in which she advocated on behalf of the drug’s approval.\n\nThe trouble is, it’s unclear where the situation goes from here.

The incident was captured in the following video footage.\n\n\"Dick Cheney is a notable war criminal, has committed atrocities during his time as vice president and beyond, and is a known supporter of torture,\" Anang told Common Dreams following the direct action. \"That is something I am not OK with, as a young person and an activist. My generation wants peace. We're tired of war, and we're tired of war mongers like Cheney.\"\n\nAnang was not the only person on Tuesday to question the former vice president's track record.

This threshold gives backers of the deal enough votes to prevent passage of the disapproval resolution, meaning there will be no need for a presidential veto. The public commitments followed a grassroots pressure campaign, waged by people in Iran, the diaspora, and across the United States.\n\nThe development was embraced by backers of diplomacy.\n\n\"This victory, which countless organizations and individuals contributed to, proves the power of grassroots advocacy,\" said Rabbi Joseph Berman, government affairs liaison for Jewish Voice for Peace. \"This achievement demonstrates that advocates of peace and justice can win over the well-financed advocates of war.\"\n\nUnclear if deliberate or coincidental, but flood of key Senators announcing Iran Deal support right after Cheney spoke is funny either way. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) September 8, 2015\n\nHowever, the deal's backers say that efforts are far from over.\n\n\"Now that there is sufficient support in Congress to protect the agreement, we should move swiftly to implement its terms,\" declared Global Zero, an international movement for the elimination of nuclear weapons, in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nAnd Phyllis Bennis", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

She contracted whooping cough, an illness that would plague her for seven months and resist five courses of antibiotics.\n\n“I just got sicker and sicker and sicker,” she says.\n\n“One morning I woke up and said: ‘I want a beef burger.’ So I went to a restaurant in Bangalow and I ordered the organic beef burger and I said: ‘No chips, no bread.’ The guy looked at me and said: ‘Well you won’t have much to eat then.’\n\n“I took one mouthful and it was like every pore that was in my body just lapped it up. Then I went back three days in a row and ordered the same beef burger and by the end of the third day, I didn’t have whooping cough anymore.”\n\nAs a self-described “born again meat eater”, it took Nadine some time to move on from her years of strict vegetarianism.\n\n“I resisted it. I’d buy a piece of salmon or a piece of chicken that was already cut and just sort of tip it out of the tray without touching it because I was so grossed out. It took me years to surrender to the fact that, actually, I felt 100 per cent better when I ate meat and poultry and fish.”\n\nWhat triggered Nadine’s latest personal food revolution was a cicatricial (or scarring) alopecia diagnosis. An auto-immune disorder that destroys hair follicles and replaces them with scar tissue, in some cases hair loss is gradual, without noticeable symptoms, and may go unnoticed for some time.

The earlier loans had never been paid, and more came - $192.40 in May 1829, $50.12 in June, and $50.00 in July.[14] His law practice failed to attract any significant clients because men like Dellet continued to be trusted more than Travis. By the end of his law practice in Claiborne, he had had only six cases, and had received less than a total of $4.00. By the spring of 1831, his debt was $834.[15]\n\nDellet, along with others to whom Travis owed money, had no choice but to file suit for Travis's debts to be repaid. At one point during the suit, Travis filed a plea that the case be dismissed on the grounds of infancy (he was still considered a minor in many parts of Alabama). Dellet responded by forcing Travis to stand, yelling at the courtroom \"Gentlemen, I make 'proofest' of this infant!\".[16] Travis stood humiliated in a courtroom filled with people who were roaring with laughter, and the Court's clerk issued orders for his arrest on March 31, 1831.[17]\n\nAt some point during his time in Claiborne, Travis heard stories of Texas, which was then an outlying state in the First Mexican Republic. In Texas, there was a massive amount of land speculation and immigration, with settlers coming in from the United States and Europe. There was also a strong demand for lawyers to deal with the influx of immigrants and land dealings, so he quickly made the decision to go to Texas. He promised Rosanna (now pregnant with a second child) that, while in Texas, he would earn enough money to pay back all of his debts. Rosanna trusted him to eventually return or send for her and his children. Travis avoided being arrested and left for Texas.\n\nTexas and the Alamo command\n\nIn May 1831, upon his arrival in Mexican Texas, a part of northern Mexico at the time, Travis purchased land from Stephen F. Austin, who appointed him counsel from the United States.[18] He set up a law practice in Anahuac and helped start a militia to oppose Mexican rule.[19] He subsequently became a pivotal figure in the Anahuac Disturbances and was imprisoned for his involvement.[18]\n\nTravis was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Cavalry and became the chief recruiting officer for a", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Among the actors and recording artists planning to attend are Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Fergie, Lenny Kravitz, Idina Menzel and Bryan Cranston.\n\nIn Cleveland, Republicans who have been supportive of Trump will get top billing. They include Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa), who burst onto the scene in 2014 with a playful campaign ad vowing to apply her hog-castration skills in Washington to “make ’em squeal.” Trump eyed her as a possible vice-presidential running mate, and they met on July 4, although she later took herself out of consideration.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (Ark.), who also joined the Senate last year, plans to speak as well. Cotton is among a handful of young Republicans considered likely future presidential candidates. Another is Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), although he is a vocal Trump critic and will not be in Cleveland. Instead, Sasse plans to “take his kids to watch some dumpster fires across the state,” his spokesman provocatively told reporters.\n\nAt least two of Trump’s primary opponents — Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker — are planning to address delegates in Cleveland.\n\nCruz and Walker are trying to rebuild their profiles after being wounded in the nomination battle, looking to another run in four years. Yet neither has fully endorsed Trump, and it is unclear whether either plans to vouch for him.\n\nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, another 2016 contender, also plans to speak.\n\nAmong the former Trump rivals not planning to address the convention is John Kasich, who as governor of Ohio is something of a host for the week-long gathering. He has said that he plans to be in Cleveland next week but that he does not intend to step foot in the convention hall or speak on Trump’s behalf.\n\n[Trump closes in on running mate, says he seeks experience to unite GOP]\n\nTrump’s vice-presidential running mate will give a formal address, although the runners-up also could have", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

I learned to love the hop-on-hop off bus.\n\nPortugal has a slight underdog status versus the tourism heavyweights of France, Spain and Italy. That suits just fine. Let the crowds go there.\n\nPortugal’s natural and architectural beauty doesn’t smack you in the face. It beckons you to explore, to climb hills and turn corners. You get to know it slowly, in a process of constant discovery. And the Portuguese are there to help at every turn.\n\nEat Lisbon with a knife, fork, spoon and your fingers. The capital city is stuffed with great restaurants. They’re in all the guides, which is good (you can find them) and bad (so can everyone else). But if you’re after variety and want to avoid some of the crowds, go off-piste. Look for the crowded lunch joints that dot the centre of the old town and follow the hills up toward Principe Real.\n\nLook in particular for places with a busy lunch-counter trade, a window display of fresh fish on ice, and a hint of hot oil in the air. Once the lunchtime melee dies down, slip in and explore. Order a daily special, and see what comes a few minutes later. Have wine with lunch. You’re on vacation.\n\nWhen it came to accommodation, we hit the jackpot. Baixa House, part of the i-escape.com network of boutique properties, was home away from home. Actually, it was better, because I don’t get delivery of warm, fresh baked goods every morning, as we did at Baixa House. Note to self – get to know a baker.\n\nMost importantly, Baixa House’s large, well appointed apartments come with the friendly and welcoming Sofia, who greeted us with advice, a world of recommendations, a clever cloth map and a small tin box of restaurant cards with tips on what was touristy, and what wasn’t. If you want to feel like you’re a part of central Lisbon, stay here.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to feel like a sardine crammed into one of those it-could-be-anywhere hotels, stay at the Sofitel Liberdade.

The female population had grown to 26 by the time a separate building about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the main institution was completed in 1926.[6]\n\nThe first prison escape (from behind the walls) occurred on January 19, 1914. Three inmates stole a gun and killed three prison employees and retired federal judge John Robert Thomas during the escape attempt. The convicts were later killed behind a rock ledge located on a ridge overlooking a wagon road.[7][8]\n\nRiots and lawsuits [ edit ]\n\nBy the early 1970s, advocacy groups warned the state government that the situation was becoming dire.[9] From 1970 until July 27, 1973 the facility cataloged 19 violent deaths, 40 stabbings and 44 serious beatings. On January 22, 1973, prisoners staged a hunger strike that lasted 3 days in an attempt to draw attention to the conditions at the facility.[10]\n\nOn July 27, 1973, trouble began in the prison's mess hall, reportedly by five inmates who, according to a prison spokesman, \"were doped up on something.\" It quickly spread through the rest of the facility. At the end of the riot, three days later, three inmates were dead, 12 buildings were burned, and 21 inmates and guards had been injured. Damage was estimated at $30 million.[9]\n\nA federal court in 1978 found conditions at OSP unconstitutional.[7][11] The lawsuit, filed by one inmate before the riot, was changed to a class action suit after the riot. U.S. District Judge Luther Bohannon put the Department of Correction under federal control. The last issue of the lawsuit, medical care for offenders, was settled 27 years later, in 2001.[9]\n\nConsequent to the court's orders, four new housing units were built at OSP, and in 1984 the aging East and West Cellhouses were closed. In 1983, all female inmates were moved to Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in Oklahoma City.[7]\n\nOn December 17, 1985, the inmates became disruptive, then gained control and took five employees as hostages on A and C units. Three of the hostages were seriously injured before their release the next day. The disturbance caused more than $375,000 in damage and two of the hostages were permanently disabled.

{"id": "sample_5_470", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " by Chrome Story we received news of this device breaking cover early this morning. According to the FCC filings and a few early listings here and here, ASUS is set to launch a new convertible device with some really sweet confirmed specs. Here’s what we’re seeing so far:\n\nSkylake m3-6Y30\n\n8GB RAM\n\n32GB Internal Storage\n\n12.5″ Screen IPS\n\n360-degree hinge\n\nAluminum Build\n\n2 USB Type-C ports\n\nMicro SD slot\n\nBacklit Keyboard (we’ll talk about this below)\n\nSome of those things (ports, build, hinge) come from the FCC filing. Those parts are pretty certain from photos. Keep in mind, the FCC is only concerned with antennas and such, so things like memory, storage, and screen are secondary. The details on processor, screen, storage, etc. are all coming from listings that have this device for sale already.\n\nWe’re Still Uncertain On Some Things\n\nFirst, we’re pretty sure this is ‘Cave’ based on all we’ve found over the past months. You can read more here. ‘Cave’ has been in development since June and the timeline fits. We’ve been tracking it a bit longer than ‘Kevin’ (or as most know it, the Samsung Chromebook Pro). Almost everything we know about ‘Cave’ all fits here, so we are pretty confident.\n\nOne issue we have: one of the listings above show the device to have a FHD 1080p screen. It certainly looks like a 16:9 screen (for those who love that layout, this is welcome news), but the resolution doesn’t line up with what we’ve seen in development. We broke back in September that ‘Cave’ will have a High-Res screen. 1080p has been deemed ‘standard’ by the Chromium developers at this point, so the clear sign that ‘Cave’ will be High-Res means one of two things: we’ll see this device as a High-Res version (like the HP Chromebook 13 G1) or it is not ‘Cave’. We are leaning towards the former, assuming ASUS may have some variations on offer here.\n\nAnother unconfirmed but likely spec is a backlit keyboard.

Nothing had been set in stone yet.\n\nYou participated in the studio recording of Kraftwerk's album \"Radio-Aktivität\" and helped write song for the album \"Trans Europa Express.\" How did Kraftwerk go about composing new material?\n\nWe held writing sessions in the Kling Klang Studio, which meant that we stood in a circle and improvised - like jazz musicians. That was the second half of the 70s; there were no computers. But we had a little music machine that could repeat back 16 tones. That was the only machine in our studio.\n\nRead more: Kraftwerk's plagiarism lawsuit could go to European court\n\nWe would improvise, look at each other, laugh our heads off and record ourselves. During these sessions, we created the raw material for our compositions. Basically, it was simply entertainment that we transferred to music. The result was a polyphonic composition with multiple voices.\n\nWas the band aware of how forward-looking its music was?\n\nKarl Bartos was a member of Kraftwerk for over 15 years\n\nWe couldn't have predicted how Kraftwerk's music would be received. When we were mixing at the sequencer, that was basically the continuation of the music technology that had been in development in Europe since the Enlightenment.\n\nAutomated music has always been interesting. But I think the decisive thing for us in the late 70s was that the balance between humans and machines really worked.\n\nThe computer changed that. I don't want to say that we didn't manage to achieve interaction with the computer, but we did make a few errors in our thought process.\n\nWhat kind of errors?\n\nWe tried to transfer the thought process behind improvisation to a digital interface. And at the beginning we made the mistake of producing tracks in advance and then turning them on and off because we thought that was improvisation. But that was just a kind of fake improvisation.\n\nIn the 80s, one particular hobby - cycling - became more and more important for the band…\n\nImagine you've just ridden 200 kilometers on your bike. What are you still able to achieve when you go home and sit down? Your pulse sinks to under 50, you have no desires and are perfectly content. When that happens over the course of years, then you just lose the drive to invent music.\n\nRead more: German electronic music legends Kraftwerk to open Tour de France in", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It will feel like you’re having fun, but it’s short lived manic superficial fun. It’s the type of fun that people like Charlie Sheen and Marco Rubio have where it’s all cocaine and yelling about warlocks until you wake up one morning covered in groupon receipts and little 2 oz. plastic bottles of Fireball cinnamon whiskey and realize you have seriously destroyed your own life and possibly a good section of Florida. My point in all of this is that I’ve found my winter show. It’s a million episodes long, problematic as hell, and roughly the same shit happens every time I watch it. I’m watching Law & Order: SVU.\n\nL&O usually begins with a cold open involving someone jogging or looking wistfully into a pan while frying a single egg because they’re a detective with a lot on their mind. Honestly you can get five minutes into one of these things without knowing whether you’re watching a TV show or an Excedrin commercial. Then a casio keyboard bangs out the intro theme, a sort of jazzy Neon Indian groove set to a series of instagrams put together by someone who only knows how to use the earlybird filter. What follows is the most offensive show on television. This show is harder to watch than the Mythbusters episode where they tried to make Jankum.\n\nEvery episode involves a rape. EVERY episode. I suppose this “Dick Wolf” bro thinks this is a fine way for him to get jokes off about this sort of thing. Why not do an episode about women in comedy, or have a sex-positive guest star of color like Aziz Ansari? Why is every episode the same? Literally what is a procedural drama?\n\nAnyways, once the crime of the day is upon us we see a core cast of investigators awkwardly lob dialogue back and forth trying to subtly explain which real news story is serving as the basis for the current plot. The Ariel Castro episode features such illuminating exposition as Ice-T saying “this is like Ariel Castro.” There is also a villain who uses a drink called Five Crazy to get amped up for crime, which I think is supposed to be a fictionalization of Four Loko but that’s actually a real thing (it’s where you pour a Five Hour Energy", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

No Italian composer could be counted as truly successful even in Italian theaters without first having achieved recognition in Paris.\n\nUnlike symphonies, sonatas, and other “classical forms,” no one considered opera “art” until Wagner. It was theater—musical theater. It was culturally comparable to Broadway musicals.\n\nExcept that everywhere but Italy and France it was nearly always in a foreign language.\n\nItalians attended only to Italian opera. The French had a choice of Italian or French opera. German-speaking countries had some German opera, but it was never a popular as Italian or French opera.\n\nAnd the English? English opera between Purcell and Britten hardly existed except as translations of Italian opera. In that guise, spoken dialog replaced the recitative.\n\nOpera had been a business since the first commercial opera house opened in 1637. But it had always appealed to the aristocracy. In early 19th-century Paris, composers like Rossini and Meyerbeer quickly learned how to appeal to a mass audience.\n\nThose who loved the older operas lamented the deficiencies of these new composers. They claimed that the popular composers plagiarized themselves. They wrote the same empty formulas over and over again. All their music sounded alike.\n\nClassical music lovers despised Rossini in particular because he wasn’t an especially good composer. He stopped his musical education when someone told him he knew enough to compose operas.\n\nHe never learned counterpoint.

Now, customers can simply ask Alexa to set the oven for chicken nuggets, or pizza, or cookies, or whatever else they’re heating up that night. “We tried to make it one step quicker.”\n\nSo the number of skills has grown, as has the range of available features, as has the consumer embrace of the platform, which Rabuchin describes as “commensurate” with the hockey stick uptick in Alexa abilities. So far, it’s one of the great tech success stories of the last decade. Now comes the hard part.\n\nUndiscovered Countries\n\nIf the Alexa skills origin story sounds familiar, that’s because so far it maps pretty neatly with that of Apple’s App Store. It’s a smaller scale, but the pacing is about right, as well as the types of developers that are signing on in the early days.\n\nFor Amazon, that’s encouraging. The App Store is an indisputable success. But its growth wasn’t without pains, some of which Alexa may be feeling soon, if it hasn’t already.\n\n“We know what happened when Apple opened up the App Store and developers started pouring applications in there,” says Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey. “Suddenly it became really, really hard for developers to get in front of their intended customers. There became this big problem of clutter.”\n\nA problem that, notably, persists even today, nearly nine years later. And while Amazon has fewer skills to get lost among, its voice-first paradigm makes searching through those skills much more difficult. That creates potential frustrations for customers and developers alike; the former doesn’t know where to find skills they might enjoy, and the latter doesn’t see a return on the invested time spent creating the skill in the first place.\n\nNot surprisingly, Amazon has taken steps to mitigate the problem. It sends weekly emails to Alexa users highlighting recently added skills. And after a year of the skills interface consisting of just a list within the Alexa app, the company last summer launched a skills store online, complete with ratings and reviews. All of which helps, but still requires staring at a screen—which", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_5_499", "config_id": 5, "prompt": " an influencer outreach strategy,” and my usual response, either under my breath or out loud, is, “No, you need a customer advocacy strategy.” Many think they are one and the same but they are actually very different.\n\nAn influencer is someone with significant social capital. They may have several thousand Twitter followers, RSS subscribers and Facebook “likes” and they are frequently retweeted, quoted, interviewed, invited to speak at conferences and may even have written a book or two.\n\nInfluencers have a considerable amount of reach, hence all the attention that big brands give to them by seeding them with products before they hit the market or giving them insight into the product roadmap. The relationship between a brand and influencers is usually built upon incentives.\n\nAn advocate is different. They may only have a few hundred followers, may not even blog and many won’t know what an RSS feed is. The main difference is that advocates don’t need or want incentives. They will talk and talk and talk about the brands they care about even if the brand completely ignores them. They are vocal, passionate and always give a brand praise both on and offline.\n\nWhen comparing the reach of an influencer to an advocate, the influencer clearly has an advantage. But I would argue that if you take the collective reach of all your advocates and compare it to the reach of influencers, the numbers will show that the advocates’ reach is much wider.\n\nImagine for a second what the impact would be if a brand paid just a little attention to its advocates. Most advocates are very easy to approach. While influencers consider themselves influencers, advocates don’t really care to label themselves. And that makes a brand’s job so much easier.\n\nIdentifying advocates is really not that hard to do. If you spend enough time in on Facebook, you will begin to see which fans stand out based on how they interact with your content (share, comment, like, etc.). There are tools like Syncapse that are building this capability into their product roadmap.\n\nZuberance is a great tool that identifies advocates already living in your brand’s ecosystem and empowers them to share reviews and content about your product with their social circles. RowFeeder is an exceptional tool that pulls data directly from Twitter and Facebook, and allows you to easily see who is referencing your brand and how often.\n\nI have never studied the", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}
