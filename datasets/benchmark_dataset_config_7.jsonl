In sign of an increased confidence in the future of the cryptocurrency, Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) has doubled its initial public offering (IPO) amount to $1 bln.\n\nAn amendment filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday includes the new figure as the agency reconsiders its March decision to deny the Bitcoin ETF market access.\n\nBy outperforming the US dollar by almost 50 percent, Bitcoin surpassed the growth of the Mexican Peso, Silver, Gold and Russian Ruble to become the best performing currency so far in 2017.\n\nFiat, gold, silver behind\n\nAccording to a chart provided by Bitcoin data analyst SG Kinsmann, Bitcoin price outpaced other currencies and safe haven assets such as gold and silver with significantly wide margins, with the Mexican Peso and Silver, the third and fourth best performing currencies and assets year to date barely achieving a 12 percent change against the US dollar.\n\nAltcoins, Ethereum fairy tale\n\nThus far, 2017 has been a successful year for both Bitcoin investors and alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) traders, with leading altcoins or crypto assets such as Ethereum achieving a $5 bln market cap in early April.\n\nIn January, the market cap of Ethereum fell short of $1 bln. Within four months, Ether price, the native token of Ethereum, increased by over five times.\n\nThe growth of Ethereum can be attributed to the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and its growing development community participated by large-scale corporations, organizations and businesses.\n\nBitcoin moves\n\nThe Bitcoin market, however, experienced some major changes in its ecosystem earlier this year.\n\nTo begin with, the Philippines and Japan legalized Bitcoin and its businesses in their respective regions. The Indian government announced the likelihood of a regulatory framework for Bitcoin being implemented by as early as May. Some of Japan’s largest retail giants including Bic Camera, which hold a massive influence over the Japanese technology and consumer markets, began to accept Bitcoin payments at their locations.\n\nThe major driving force of Bitcoin price in 2017 is suspected to be the resolution of the Bitcoin network’s current scalability problems. The Bitcoin network’s one MB cap on block size is causing Blockchain congestion, a drastic increase in fees at times and long confirmation times.\n\nIf Bitcoin scalability issues are addressed within this year, with innovative solutions such as Bitcoin Core’s Segregated Witness (SegWit), Andrew Lee’s Extension Blocks or other potential emerging solutions, Bitcoin price will most likely demonstrate an exponential mid and long-term increase.\n\nOn April 26, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin officially surpassed $1,300, breaking its previous all-time high price established at the $1,277 margin. However, Cointelegraph reported that most analysts see a high level of instability in the current Bitcoin price trend due to the banking issues of leading Bitcoin exchanges such as Bitfinex and OKCoin.\n\nIf the conflict between banks and Bitcoin exchanges are addressed, Bitcoin scalability issue is solved and mainstream adoption in Japan, India and Philippines continue, Bitcoin price will likely demonstrate an exponential mid and long-term growth.\n\nRead more: How to Buy Bitcoin: Best Practices, Where to Buy, TipsBitcoin continues to outperform every reserve and fiat currency across the world.

{"id": "sample_7_14", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " new hardware for Windows 8 chose a Surface Pro, another tablet, or a tablet-PC hybrid. This skews the data because analysts aren't tracking PCs and tablets as a unified market.\n\nDon't hate Windows 8\n\nWindows 8 is a radical shift, but it also offers the comforts of Windows 7.\n\nWindows 8 is a dramatic shift from earlier versions of Windows. Its Modern interface was designed with touch-enabled gadgets in mind, and Windows 8 is an attempt to straddle the line between a traditional PC and a tablet. Microsoft melds the two, but in a Jekyll-Hyde, split-personality way that many users aren’t comfortable with. Plus, of course, there’s no Start button (gasp!). Yet, Windows 8's desktop mode is nearly identical to Windows 7, and you can easily simulate the Start button with a third-party add-on.\n\nAs popular opinion seems to hold, millions of people using older, slower PCs were itching to buy a new one, but decided not to because the radical new Windows 8 turned them off.\n\nThat's doubtful. If it’s time for a new PC, you're going to get one, and that's separate from the decision to upgrade your OS.\n\nWindows 8 may be to blame for the perception that PC sales are declining, but not because people hate it. The problem lies in how PCs are sold and how the PC market is measured. In a nutshell, Windows 8 sales don't necessarily equate with PC sales.\n\nBlame Microsoft's great deal\n\nIf new processor, graphics or networking technologies are introduced, you'll need new hardware to take advantage of them. You can upgrade your existing hardware incrementally, or buy a whole new PC that incorporates the new technology.\n\nA new OS, however, doesn't always require new hardware. New PCs will come pre-loaded with the newest OS, but that's a fringe benefit. Most people don’t buy a whole new computer just to upgrade their OS.\n\nIt's even more true with Windows 8 than with previous versions of Windows for two reasons. First, Microsoft went to great lengths to ensure that Windows 8 runs efficiently on minimal resources. It out-performs Windows 7 and works better on weaker, legacy hardware. Unless you really want a touchscreen, there may be no compelling reason to get a new PC with Windows 8.\n\nSecond, Microsoft offered a great deal with Windows 8. New versions of Windows are usually high enough to dissuade people from buying the OS by itself, swaying people to buy a new PC instead. Why pay $150 or more for the operating system alone if you can buy a whole new PC with that pre-installed for only $100 more?\n\nMicrosoft offered Windows 8 for only $40 in its first few months. At that price, it was a much easier decision just to buy the OS—especially if new hardware wasn't required.\n\nPC vendors have traditionally relied on a new Windows OS as a carrot to lure customers, but that's a poor incentive, and not one PC vendors should depend upon. The PC itself has to offer some compelling reason to attract customers beyond their desire for the latest OS.\n\nDefine 'personal computer'\n\nMicrosoft Is a Surface Pro a PC or a tablet?\n\nThe popular narrative follows that we’re in a \"post-PC\" era, in which tablets are going to kill off the PC. Ominous sales figures seem to support the theory.\n\nHowever, this scenario is misleading. Tablets are personal computers, in fact, just a different size and shape than a traditional desktop or laptop PC. The tablet market can’t really kill the PC market, because tablets are the PC market.\n\nCue the tablet naysayers and PC purists. Despite stubborn assertions that tablets are no match for PCs, a tablet is perfectly capable of performing the functions most people use their PCs for. In many ways, the tablet is a better choice.\n\nThen, there’s the “problem” of the Surface Pro and other Windows 8 Pro tablets. When IDC or other industry analysts consider PC sales versus tablet sales, is a Windows 8 Pro tablet a PC or a tablet? Technically it's both, but a spokesperson confirmed that in the eyes of IDC if it can be detached from and used without a keyboard, it's a tablet and is not counted in the PC sales data.\n\nIf the Surface Pro and other Windows 8 Pro tablets suddenly skyrocketed in sales, Windows 8 could dramatically increase in OS market share even as PC sales continue to plummet in relation to tablets, or what's considered the overall personal computer market.\n\nThe combination of the fact that Windows 8 was offered so cheaply and runs fine on older hardware, and the fact that many of those buying new Windows 8 PCs will opt for tablets like the Surface Pro both adversely affect PC sales as", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_7_15", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " passing at roughly the same rate for Spider-Man and for the FF. (Stay with me, I’m just showing my work, here.)\n\nIn the fall of 1968, Susan Richards goes into labor. (Our first hint of what’s to come is that fact that Sue’s pregnancy takes place over the course of nearly twelve months instead of the customary 37 to 42 weeks of gestation, the first time that the Fantastic Four’s stories don’t conform to ‘real time.’)\n\nMost children are only a few minutes old when officially named. Reed and Sue’s baby, born in November 1968, is not named for nearly THIRTEEN MONTHS, our time, receiving the sobriquet “Franklin Benjamin Richards” in January 1970.\n\nThe Mind Games Start Early\n\nTwo things about this are significant to someone with a keen eye (and a mind for conspiracy theories): One, the thirteen months of stories we have been presented cannot actually cover thirteen months of time for the characters, as not even absent-minded professor Reed Richards would wait a year to pick a name for his firstborn. Two, the child is named for his grandfather, later revealed to be a time-traveler who looks out for him, and (Sorry, I mixed up my grandpa stories!) his ‘Uncle Ben,’ the most physically imposing member of the Fantastic Four. In short, it’s almost as if his parents were influenced into naming him so that a powerful fellow would be particularly interested in his welfare.\n\nVery early in his life, Franklin is shown to have unusual abilities (he is able to see his mother while invisible, and awakens The Thing at one point using latent psychic powers.) After interactions with Annihilus and later Ultron, Franklin’s powers became a running theme, scaling up and down as well as turning on and off with relative regularity. No less an authority than Professor X quantified him as one of the most powerful mutants alive. By the time of Fantastic Four #134 (May 1973) a five-year-old Franklin looks to be the size of a (rather creepy) three-year-old.\n\nOkay, I may be underestimating the boy’s size. But by the time of Fantastic Four #170 (May 1976) Franklin looks like… a rather creepy (and strangely brunette) three-year-old.\n\nAnd by the time of Fantastic Four #224 (November 1980), the now 12-year-old Franklin looks and acts approximately seven or so.\n\nAnd is it just me, or does it look like he just made Mommy’s pants disappear? Now, at this point, much of my speculation is based on what you expect a child of a given age to look or act like, but how can we explain it when, nearly a year later, Franklin seems to be five again?\n\nThat particular interaction with Annihilus is interesting, as well, as it leads to Franklin once again manifesting his super-powers (openly.) The answer is as simple as it is frightening:\n\nFranklin Richards is whatever age he wants to be.\n\nAnd he not only makes himself that age, he makes it so that he’s ALWAYS been that age, and no one ever remembers anything different BECAUSE HE CHANGES THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE MARVEL UNIVERSE. In a very real way, Franklin Richards IS ‘Marvel Time.’ And the entirety of his universe ages more slowly because Franklin doesn’t want to grow up and he certainly doesn’t want things to change too much while he enjoys his extended childhood.\n\nWhere It Gets All Icky And Freudian\n\nBy the early 80’s Franklin is firmly established as being somewhere between 6 and 9 years old, when the first echoes of a change start to occur in his universe. Seeing as how he was born in 1968, Franklin is starting to reach what should be the age of puberty, where he should start liking girls and growing up. By no coincidence, the Marvel Universe of this era is witness to the events that the X-Men would come to know as ‘Days of Future Past.’\n\nFor those of you that don’t know, ‘DoFP’ is an alternate reality where all the mutants are nearly wiped out, and Franklin is the most powerful creature left in the world, and he has a girlfriend and you can’t call her and check it or nothin’, because she’s from the future. In short, it’s the quintessential adolescent power fantasy of heroism and sexual potency. During this same timeframe, Susan Richards becomes pregnant again, and Reed is forced to try and save his child from cosmically irratiated body chemistry.

The old design, and atmosphere was stunning and we couldn't believe our eyes. Later in 2005 things has changed. They redesigned almost all old levels. Some of them became smaller, simpler (still nice, but different), and some levels were removed. After the release in 2007 we played the game a lot, and quickly noticed that some areas are missing. We opened forums, and talked countless nights about those for almost a year. Nowdays we could say, we have a full vision about GSC's old levels, due to the collected materials, videos and forgotten screenshots. We decided to remake those stunning areas, maybe they won't be the same, but we will try everything to make them look really nice, as we always wanted to see them. In early 2009, GSC released a build from 2004, which contained many old materials. We used some of the sdk objects for the level remakes, but adjusted (and bugfixed) them for our liking, also we didn't throw out our own levels. So expect to see our own Darkscape, Dead City, Rostok Factory and some more in Lost Alpha :)\n\nAlso need to say, Lost Alpha addon is not just about levels and levels. We will try to make a somewhat, but not fully restricted alife, and deliver a lot of new, never seen features, among with some old ones, which many people wanted to see for long. If you are interested in, check the Features menu for FAQ, Interview, Features List, and many more. Also do not forget to check the gallery, and the movies. All comments are welcome, also we are glad to see suggestions too, however at this stage those won't be considered. Thanks for your understanding!\n\nFinally, we would like to thank to the old Stalker Team this wonderful game. Without them, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. wouldn't be a \"dream-game\".

{"id": "sample_7_31", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " effect.\n\nInfluencing factors [ edit ]\n\nTotal number of reptilian and amphibian species on seven small and large islands in the West Indies\n\nDegree of isolation (distance to nearest neighbour, and mainland)\n\nLength of isolation (time)\n\nSize of island (larger area usually facilitates greater diversity)\n\nThe habitat suitability which includes: Climate (tropical versus arctic, humid versus arid, etc.) Initial plant and animal composition if previously attached to a larger land mass (e.g. marsupials, primates) The current species composition\n\nLocation relative to ocean currents (influences nutrient, fish, bird, and seed flow patterns)\n\nSerendipity (the impacts of chance arrivals)\n\nHuman activity\n\nHistorical record [ edit ]\n\nThe theory can be studied through the fossils, which provide a record of life on Earth. 300 million years ago, Europe and North America lay on the equator and were covered by steamy tropical rainforests. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during the Carboniferous Period and as the climate grew drier, rainforests fragmented. Shrunken islands of forest were uninhabitable for amphibians but were well suited to reptiles, which became more diverse and even varied their diet in the rapidly changing environment; this Carboniferous rainforest collapse event triggered an evolutionary burst among reptiles.[2]\n\nResearch experiments [ edit ]\n\nThe theory of island biogeography was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his student Daniel Simberloff in the mangrove islands in the Florida Keys.[6] Species richness on several small mangroves islands were surveyed. The islands were fumigated with methyl bromide to clear their arthropod communities. Following fumigation the immigration of species onto the islands was monitored. Within a year the islands had been recolonised. Islands closer to the mainland recovered faster as predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography. The effect of island size was not tested, since all islands were of approximately equal size.\n\nResearch conducted at the rainforest research station on Barro Colorado Island has yielded a large number of publications concerning the ecological changes following the formation of islands, such as the local extinction of large predators and the subsequent changes in prey populations.[citation needed]\n\nApplications in conservation biology [ edit ]\n\nWithin a few years of the publishing of the theory, its potential application to the field of conservation biology had been realised and was being vigorously debated in ecological circles.[7] The idea that reserves and national parks formed islands inside human-altered landscapes (habitat fragmentation), and that these reserves could lose species as they 'relaxed towards equilibrium' (that is they would lose species as they achieved their new equilibrium number, known as ecosystem decay) caused a great deal of concern. This is particularly true when conserving larger species which tend to have larger ranges. A study by William Newmark, published in the journal Nature and reported in the New York Times, showed a strong correlation between the size of a protected U.S. National Park and the number of species of mammals.\n\nThis led to the debate known as single large or several small (SLOSS), described by writer David Quammen in The Song of the Dodo as \"ecology's own genteel version of trench warfare\".[8] In the years after the publication of Wilson and Simberloff's papers ecologists had found more examples of the species-area relationship, and conservation planning was taking the view that the one large reserve could hold more species than several smaller reserves, and that larger reserves should be the norm in reserve design. This view was in particular championed by Jared Diamond. This led to concern by other ecologists, including Dan Simberloff, who considered this to be an unproven over-simplification that would damage conservation efforts. Habitat diversity was as or more important than size in determining the number of species protected.\n\nIsland biogeography theory also led to the development of wildlife corridors as a conservation tool to increase connectivity between habitat islands. Wildlife corridors can increase the movement of species between parks and reserves and therefore increase the number of species that can be supported, but they can also allow for the spread of disease and pathogens between populations, complicating the simple proscription of connectivity being good for biodiversity.\n\nIn species diversity, island biogeography most describes allopatric speciation. Allopatric speciation is where new gene pools arise out of natural selection in isolated gene pools. Island biogeography is also useful in considering sympatric speciation, the idea of different species arising from one ancestral species in the same area. Interbreeding between the two differently adapted species would prevent speciation, but in some species, sympatric speciation appears to have occurred.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

I think he's going to be great at 11. He's a great lead in to Rush.\"\n\nPete Spriggs, WSB program director, said this will enable Cain to have more flexibility as he continues work in other venues. Cain had been syndicated on several dozen stations until earlier this year.

It's an honor they feel this show is good enough to be put on at that time. I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited. How many people leave music radio and get a chance like this?\"\n\nVon Haessler said he was a little nervous when he began the weekday show, wondering if the audience would accept him.

Our motto is we'll have as much fun every day as the news cycle allows us.\"\n\nHe thinks this is the best show he's ever been part of, even better than the Regular Guys. \"We have no artificial limits on the ability of each person to perform their best,\" he said. \"At the last show, there were artificial limits.

They offer what we have, and what we are, up to the cosmos.\n\nBut what if the improbable were to happen? Here on Earth, 10-year-old CDs are puttering out. What about a pair of 40-year-old records careening through outer space? Even if extraterrestrials found and figured out how to work the Golden Record, would it play anymore?\n\nActually, yes, experts say.\n\n\"The gold records that were launched into space were specially constructed discs for the purposes of space travel,\" said Peter Alyea, a digital conservation specialist at the Library of Congress who specializes in audio recordings. \"I believe they were designed to last for a very, very long time and so should still be playable. This kind of disc is not something you could buy commercially at a record store.\"\n\nAnd besides, Voyager's Golden Record has thus far been kept safe from the elements—high temperatures, oxygen, water—known to deteriorate Earthly records. (Voyager is now operating at about negative 110 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n\n“If I had to guess, I'd say it's as fresh and new as the day it was placed aboard the spacecraft,\" said David Doody, an engineer on the Voyager mission at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in an email. \"It's been stored in a vacuum more perfect than any attainable on Earth, and protected from dust and cosmic rays by an aluminum metal case.\"\n\nThat protective aluminum case has had quite the adventure—it got a dose of radiation near Jupiter and was blasted with space dust in Saturn's ring plane—but Doody says it has been \"basically always shielded\" at least enough to protect the record's functionality. \"In all, it might have lost a little luster at worst, in my humble opinion,\" he said. \"I'd also venture to guess that it would be in playable condition for many hundreds of millennia.”\n\nWhich raises a theoretical question about what version of Earth the rest of the universe might first encounter, and what songs or sounds we might include today that didn't exist in 1977. The Golden Record, after all, is more of a time capsule than a broadcast. (It doesn't even include any hip-hop, which was still in its cultural nascence the year the Voyagers were launched.) Of course many of the record's sounds have retained the timeless quality they must have had four decades ago—like this greeting from Kurt Waldheim, then the secretary general of the United Nations:\n\nWe step out of our solar system into the universe seeking only peace and friendship—to teach if we are called upon, to be taught if we are fortunate. We know full well that our planet and all its inhabitants are but a small part of this immense universe that surrounds us, and it is with humility and hope that we take this step.\n\nNASA has since moved on to new projects to share music with other galaxies, and humanity has graduated beyond the record as the go-to audio format. In 2008, for instance, scientists beamed a song directly into deep space, aiming for the North Star 431 light years away from Earth. That tune, a Beatles classic from the decade before Voyager launched, was \"Across the Universe.\"\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

{"id": "sample_7_42", "config_id": 7, "prompt": ".\n\nThe game fulfills all of the needs of Virtual Reality: it is designed for the forthcoming Oculus Rift™ headset (but it is also playable on a standard monitor) and motion-based controllers like the Sixense STEM™ (or Razer Hydra™) and the YEI Technology PRIOVR™ to simulate your hands movements.\n\nYou will naturally interact with the world: pick-up objects, open them or use them just like you would in real life.\n\nYou will hear the hero's thoughts. You will control his body through your own. You will live his life while the story unravels itself around your actions and choices.\n\nLoading Human will be released for Windows and Mac OS as soon as the consumer versions of the Oculus Rift will be mass marketed (we expect Q1 2015).\n\nFor a deeper explanation about Loading Human's game experience, check the video below:\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with\n\nsound 00:00 00:00\n\n25 August 2185.\n\nPrometheus has just arrived at his father's base to begin his intensive training for a deep space mission. In a few years, he will have to guide the spaceship \"Origin\" toward an energy source located in the Eagle Nebula. But many things will happen to him before take off...\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with\n\nsound 00:00 00:00\n\nDuring the game you will travel into Prometheus's mind, randomly reliving fragments of his memories in a non-linear way (think of Quantum Leap: you will \"zap\" from one memory to another). The action will start at the North Pole, in your father's base, where you'll have to train in order to complete your mission: retrieve the quintessence - a dark-energy source found in the Eagle Nebula (M16) - and bring it back to your father, who needs it in order to survive. But during the training period you'll meet Alice, a woman you'll fall in love with... and leaving for the mission will be harder than ever: your father won't accept it…\n\nWe really don't want to spoil the story, all we can say is that while you will travel from one memory fragment to another, you will soon discover a whole new reality in-between...\n\nLoading Human's story is deeply connected with the gameplay. You will play a story that will evolve around you and your actions. It is quite a unique type of game, that merges virtual reality, point 'n click adventure design and motion-controlled interactions to give you the most immersive narrative experience you've ever lived.\n\nThis will be the first act of a 3-chapter saga. The approximate gameplay experience of this chapter will be about three to four hours minimum (experience could double if played at a slow pace speed) and the first chapter encompassing the following locations: scientific base (4 quarters: gym, kitchen, open space and bedroom), the North Pole around the base, a spaceship, an underwater lab and the Greenhouse. You will play in those environments and go back in them more than once, and every time they will be different: daytime, nighttime, sunset, different lightning, and because you will travel within memories, you will actually travel through time, so even the geometry of the location will be different (the furnitures, the way the space is organized etc etc..)\n\n\"In virtual reality, what matters is the perceived freedom of interaction with the world.\"\n\nIn Loading Human, you will use your hands and sight to interact with the world and proceed in the story. This means that each object is takeable and has its unique interactive script: you can pick-up a vinyl, take it out of its box, use it on a gramophone and voilà! You'll be hearing the song you chose. We scripted the entire world in order to give you as much authenticity as possible, so even when you'll be eager to proceed in the story you will enjoy the places, the objects and the freedom that we'll have designed to support your journey.\n\nMotion controllers are the future of VR games.\n\nWhen you wear an Oculus Rift™ (or a Project Morpheus™ headset) you cannot see the controller you're using, that's why you need a direct visual feedback of your controls INSIDE the virtual world.\n\nIn order to enjoy the freedom of action without being detached from the experience, you need to BE the controller and only the motion controllers can mimic your movements in this new virtual dimension: the Sixense STEM™, the YEI PRIOVR™, and the Razer Hydra™ are with no doubt the best choices available at the moment to make this experience truly next-gen.\n\nWe will try to adopt any new motion controller and headset that will come out in the next year and apply it in", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_47", "config_id": 7, "prompt": ", and the lowest in Wyoming.[338][339] Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[340] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[341]\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2016 was 1.82 births per 1000 woman.[342] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[343] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[344] Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, owing to the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[345]\n\nHealth\n\nThe United States had a life expectancy of 78.6 years at birth in 2017, which was the third year of declines in life expectancy following decades of continuous increase. The recent decline is largely due to sharp increases in the drug overdose and suicide rates. Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks.[346][347]\n\nIncreasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.[348] Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere.[349][350] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[351] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[352]\n\nIn 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[353] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[354] Suicide rates have increased in nearly every state from 1999 through 2016, and is a leading cause of death in the United States.[355] Drug overdoses, two-thirds of which are from opioids, are the leading cause of death for those under the age of 50.[356]\n\nThe U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[357] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[358] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[359]\n\nHealth-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2017, 12.2% of the population did not carry health insurance.[360] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[361][362] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[363] Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014,[needs update] though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[364][365]\n\nEducation\n\nThe University of Virginia , founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States. Universal government-funded education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately funded institutions.\n\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[366]\n\nAbout 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) introduced five bills on Wednesday to choke off the expected flood of corporate cash. \"We are facing a potential threat to our democracy,\" Grayson said in an interview with HuffPost. \"Unlimited corporate spending on campaigns means the government is up for sale and that the law itself will be bought and sold. It would be political bribery on the largest scale imaginable.\" Grayson introduced a handful of bills on Wednesday -- the Business Should Mind Its Own Business Act, the Corporate Propaganda Sunshine Act, the End Political Kickbacks Act, and two other measures. The Business Should Mind Its Own Business Act would impose a 500 percent excise tax on corporate contributions to political committees and on corporate expenditures on political advocacy campaigns. The Corporate Propaganda Sunshine Act would require public companies to report what they spend to influence public opinion on any matter other than the promotion of their goods and services. The End Political Kickbacks Act would restrict political contributions by government contractors.\n\nThe other measures would apply antitrust regulations to political committees and bar corporations from securities exchanges unless the corporation is certified in compliance with election law. \"This case is basically about an effort to get around that. Citizens United took corporate money and tried to influence an election,\" said Lisa Gilbert of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. \"These are all pieces of good policy. I hope they draw attention to the potential frightening implications of Citizens United.\"\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/...\n\nBTW: One of my 'insane right wing crazy associates' that I work with sent me the below video in an email. Talk about re-writing history, this is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen. Has anyone else been sent this video? Does anyone know who sponsored it? I think we should find our pretty damn quick who the heck is putting this shit out there...\n\nJust wanted to let you know that there is some crazy shifting of the entire mess that Bush left us right onto our own party, and this rewriting of history seems like this is the way the Republicans are going to 'write many of their upcoming political ads'....if you get my drift.\n\nThanks...its getting scary out there. Thank god Congressman Grayson has our back and stands up and reminds America every chance he gets, on the bullshit that the Republicans try to pull over on people. The Karl Rove rule of thumb: Just keep repeating lies over and over again, and then the 'lies' somehow 'morph' into the 'new truth' is alive and well in the Republican party, and the new 'meme'....that our nation got where it is today because of President Obama and the Democratic party, seems to be the way the Republicans are going to try to take back 'our country'. We have to figure out a way to fight this message, and I hope someone in President Obama's public relations office is working out a significant strategy to stop this insane blame game before it catches up with us. I think that this may come down to President Obama turning the tables on Wall Street BIG-TIME and conducting a very strong campaign against the same 'shadow elite' that are now willing to cross over to candidates like Scott Brown. Wall Street holds no loyalty to any political party, and the last thing Wall Street cares about are the American people. I hope that President Obama sees the light because I believe that is where the next few election cycles will take us: It's either Wall Street or the American people.....it really is that simple.\n\nDon't cha just love Grayson?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for your comments....two things: first of all I know a lot of us are giving to both Haiti and working our butts off in the Coakley camp, but just wanted to remind everyone of the Act Blue for Grayson..\n\nhttp://www.actblue.com/...\n\nSecond,the Utube video that is so scary at the end of this diary is posted because I wanted to make certain everyone on our side of the isle (Democrats) understood what we are up against right now, and I personally would like to find out what organization is responsible for producing this video. It is absolutely horrifying.\n\nThanks.In other news, just to keep Kossacks up to date on the great work Congressman Grayson is doing:\n\nAnticipating a Supreme Court decision that could free corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, Rep.

{"id": "sample_7_58", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Smokers who indulge in their first cigarette shortly after waking up have an increased risk of developing lung and head and neck cancers, according to two new studies published in Cancer, a journal of the American Cancer Society. The findings may help identify smokers who have a greater risk of developing cancer. These smokers could then be more urgently targeted for smoking cessation programs.\n\nThe first studies to show a link between cigarette smoking and cancer were published back in the 1950s, but it wasn’t until 1980 that nicotine dependence was recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a psychological and physiological problem. The new studies out of Penn State College of Medicine look at nicotine dependence, which in part can be determined by the amount of time elapsed before a smoker lights up his or her first cigarette after waking up in the morning.\n\n“These smokers have higher levels of nicotine and possibly other tobacco toxins in their body, and they may be more addicted than smokers who refrain from smoking for a half hour or more,” says Joshua Muscat of the Penn State College of Medicine, who led the investigation.\n\nSubjects who smoked their first cigarette between 31 and 60 minutes after waking up were more than 30% more likely to develop lung cancer; the odds increased to nearly 80% for those who smoked in their first half-hour awake. For head and neck cancers, subjects were more than 40% more likely if they indulged in the 31-60 minute window, and nearly 60% more likely for those who smoked in their first half-hour awake.\n\n“One of the things we use to measure dependence is called the Heavyness of Smoking Index, which includes two questions,” says Dr. Richard D. Hurt, the director of the Mayo Clinic’s Nicotine Dependence Center, who is not affiliated with the new studies. “How much do you smoke, and how long after you arise do you have your first cigarette?”\n\nHurt also points out that waiting a little longer before indulging in a first cigarette of the day would mean fewer total cigarettes in a day. “The more dependent are more likely to be heavier smokers,” he says. “But you also have to look at how aggressively these people are smoking. Those who inhale deeper, hold longer, and smoke their cigarettes all the way to the end are receiving more of the harmful constituents of that cigarette.” This makes them more likely to develop cancer than those who smoke less aggressively.\n\nThe half-life of nicotine is relatively short – only two hours – so after six or eight hours of sleep, your body has gotten rid of nearly all of the nicotine you’ve inhaled the day before. There’s very little left in the body in the morning and the receptors in the brain are crying out for more nicotine. Those who are the most dependent need that cigarette earlier, and often smoke more cigarettes throughout the day, more intensely.\n\nThe takeaway here is about what you’d expect. “Stop smoking as soon as you can,” says Hurt. “We have more things to offer now than ever before. [You] can go to a physician or call a telephone quit line. We combine behavioral counseling with medications, which can double, triple, or even quadruple your chances of successfully quitting.”Smokers who indulge in their first cigarette shortly after waking up have an increased risk of developing lung and head and neck cancers, according to two new studies published in Cancer, a journal of the American Cancer Society.

{"id": "sample_7_65", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " “We have no interest,” said Philip Ellender, Koch Companies’ president of government and public affairs, “in purchasing any of the state-owned power plants in Wisconsin and any allegations to the contrary are completely false.”\n\nI pointed this out to Janczy. “Well,” she said, “they may say that, but I don’t believe it.”\n\nWhen it comes to the Kochs, progressives in Wisconsin are ready to believe the absolute worst. Inside the capitol there are dozens of agitprop signs accusing the brothers of buying the election for Walker. There are detailed lists of Koch companies and which products to boycott in order to starve them. There are articles taped to the walls from Forbes magazine (“Texas Koch Brothers Behind Wisconsin Effort To Kill Public Unions”) and the New York Times (“Koch Brothers’ Money Fuels Wisconsin Fight“). On Wednesday, a new sign started appearing around the halls, informing protesters of a picket outside the stately office building, not far from the capitol, where Koch Companies have hired seven lobbyists.\n\nIn sum: They have found the enemy, and it is Koch.\n\nBut how big a role are the Kochs actually playing in Wisconsin? A popular argument on the streets here is that Walker got $43,000 from Koch’s PAC, and that the PAC gave $1 million to the Republican Governor’s Association—a fact dug up first by Andy Kroll of Mother Jones. One protester pointed out to me that Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had spoken at one of the Kochs’ annual conferences. Thanks to the no-cameras-please PR strategy of the Kochs (none of their Madison lobbyists responded to my interview requests today), these mid-sized donations have taken on mythic proportions.\n\nHow can we judge how deep the Kochs’ influence runs? That New York Times story points out that all Koch-affiliated companies and employees gave about $1.84 million to Republicans, nationwide, in the 2010 election cycle. Americans for Prosperity, the nonprofit Tea Party-organizing group co-founded by David Koch—he’s still on the board—had a $40 million budget in 2010. (On Tuesday AFP announced a $342,000 ad buy supporting Walker.) Nationally, the labor movement spent far, far more than this. To take one example, AFSCME, whose green-shirted members have made their presence known in Madison, spent $87.5 million on the election.\n\nMany protesters, and some Democratic politicians, are blunt enough to say that the labor movement is essential because of its financial generosity. (One sign I saw listed the 10 biggest sources of money in politics to make the point that unions were the only thing keeping Democrats in the game.) Liberals here and elsewhere were infinitely more critical of the Citizens United decision than conservatives were, but that decision gave unions the same get-out-of-disclosure-free card it gave to corporations.\n\nI asked one protester, Jeanne Duffy, what the difference was between the benefits unions get when Democrats are in power, and the benefits the Kochs get when Republicans win.\n\n“Did the unions, when they were in ‘power’ “—she made scare quotes with her fingers— “pass bills to abolish the Heritage Foundation? Or did they use it to expand BadgerCare? The point of what the unions are doing is to make this a more democratic nation, where more people get more access to what they need. I mean, could you or I call Gov. Walker and get 20 minutes with him?”\n\nAh, yes, the phone call: That’s why the Koch drama dominated Madison today. On Tuesday, Buffalo Beast writer Ian Murphy had called Scott Walker’s office, posing as David Koch (and sounding very little like him) and talked his way into a 20-minute conversation. The transcript of the call was embarrassing, with the governor saying more about his strategy and peeves than he’d done in a week of media interviews. He thought he might nail the 14 Senate Democrats who’d fled the state on an ethics violation, if their lodging was paid for by unions. He was dismissive about their demands.\n\nBut the details of the conversation hardly mattered to the protesters. To them, the call was a game-changer simply because it existed. Walker took the call; he knew who Koch was; he talked for 20 minutes. Democrats in the state Assembly, who had been mentioning the Koch-Walker connections or the no-bid-power-plant theory throughout their debate, took to the floor on Wednesday to ask what Walker knew about Koch and when he knew him.\n\n“These Koch brothers!” said a worried-sounding Rep. Gary Hebl. “These Koch", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_7_66", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Gear Flashback: Our Flat Cat Gear Bobcat Titanium Stove System\n\nWhen we were preparing for our PCT thru hike in the spring of 2012, we were looking for an alcohol stove that would give us great performance and utility while still being packable and durable. We experimented with several homemade options including the well known Fancy Feast/tuna can stove that is popular with a lot of thru hikers because of its size and weight. We decided to go with a Bobcat titanium stove system purchased online from Flat Cat Gear.\n\nWe initially purchased the stove because of the complete system approach: We knew it would integrate perfectly with our 1.3 liter Evernew Pot and that the screen, stove, and all other accessories would nest neatly inside the pot. We also purchased and tested out a Trail Designs Caldera Cone stove, but really liked the packability of our Flat Cat and found it to be equally efficient. The Caldera we looked at had to be stowed in its separate plastic container/caddy which was a deal-breaker for us because we like our cooking system to be one unit including the pot. The Flat Cat pulls this off beautifully.\n\nAfter 5 months of daily use on the PCT (we typically only cooked dinners) and a week-long test hike in the Smoky Mountains, we’re still sold on the stove. One add-on piece that we did not initially see ourselves using that much was the simmer ring. We had some snap trouble with the windscreen and Jon, the Flat Cat gear guru, gave us a simmer ring to try while working out the windscreen issues. The ring really helped us with rice and pasta meals and made the titanium stove run about triple as long on the same amount of fuel. The minimal weight gain of the simmer ring paid off dividends as we could adjust from “full boil” mode and dial back the intensity of the stove for other dishes.\n\nOverall, the Bobcat system did an admirable job coping with the rigors of an extended trip (156 consecutive days). The stove itself is really a work of art and this lends to its durability as it is one solid piece of metal. Although the stove and screen could have easily held up inside a small storage sack or loose in our packs, we liked how it nested in our pot and it shared the space with the simmer ring, dish rag, lighter, and fuel measuring cup with room to spare!\n\nWe can recommend both the product and the company because Jon at Flat Cat is committed to making great products and he is always trying to make his designs better. A perfect example of this is how he repaired and replaced our original Flat Cat windscreen. Our snaps were failing because of their position on the windscreen and the fact that the titanium version of the stove runs hotter. He spent a lot of time rooting out the cause of the problem and adjusted the design as a result. We loved the stove to begin with, but his changes and willingness to improve has made the stove even better.\n\nWe hope to finally fill in some details on our “Gear” page on this site showing what we used for our PCT thru hike, and the Flat Cat Bobcat will certainly find its place among our items!Gear Flashback: Our Flat Cat Gear Bobcat Titanium Stove System\n\nWhen we were preparing for our PCT thru hike in the spring of 2012, we were looking for an alcohol stove that would give us great performance and utility while still being packable and durable. We experimented with several homemade options including the well known Fancy Feast/tuna can stove that is popular with a lot of thru hikers because of its size and weight. We decided to go with a Bobcat titanium stove system purchased online from Flat Cat Gear.\n\nWe initially purchased the stove because of the complete system approach: We knew it would integrate perfectly with our 1.3 liter Evernew Pot and that the screen, stove, and all other accessories would nest neatly inside the pot. We also purchased and tested out a Trail Designs Caldera Cone stove, but really liked the packability of our Flat Cat and found it to be equally efficient. The Caldera we looked at had to be stowed in its separate plastic container/caddy which was a deal-breaker for us because we like our cooking system to be one unit including the pot. The Flat Cat pulls this off beautifully.\n\nAfter 5 months of daily use on the PCT (we typically only cooked dinners) and a week-long test hike in the Smoky Mountains, we’re still sold on the stove. One add-on piece that we did not initially see ourselves using that much was the simmer ring. We had some snap trouble with the windscreen and Jon, the Flat Cat gear guru, gave us a simmer ring to try while working out the windscreen issues.

To mimic the functions of the human brain (albeit on a drastically reduced scale), the researchers emulated all neural elements (except the soma) with shared electronic circuits — a design decision that maximized the number of synaptic connections. To maximize energy efficiency, the researchers used analog circuits. And to maximize throughput, they interconnected the neural arrays in a tree network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's considered the most cost-effective way to simulate neurons.

{"id": "sample_7_77", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " CEO of Sunset Foods, a 76-year-old family-owned chain of groceries with five locations. This one has anchored the Butterfield Square shopping center on Libertyville's northwest side since 1998.\n\nSeated at a table in the grill area, just steps from where a small bar that will serve craft beer, boutique wine and appetizers is taking shape, Cortesi highlights various aspects of the most extensive store renovation at this location since it opened.\n\n\"It's due,\" he says.\n\nThe improvements will include a full-service floral section with trained designers, revamped liquor department with a separate entrance, outdoor seating for 75 beneath a cedar trellis, expanded offerings for a variety of foods, and prototype elements, such as the beer and wine bar, and \"build a burger\" feature.\n\n\"We're trying to improve the experience in all our locations,\" Cortesi said. \"We want our store to be a place for people to meet their friends, have dinner, an appetizer.\"\n\nThe estimated $1 million renovation in Libertyville could serve as a template for future improvements at the other Sunset locations. There is no specific plan or schedule set, although the Northbrook location is being evaluated, he said.\n\nPeriodic changes are part of any business model. However, the landscape in Libertyville would appear to warrant some urgency, given the pending arrival of Trader Joe's on the south end of town and the continued success of Mariano's Fresh Market across the street from that site in Vernon Hills.\n\n\"Most supermarkets find they need to refresh their stores about every seven years. The degree of the refresh often depends on the competitive environment,\" said Jon Hauptman, a partner with Willard Bishop Ltd., an industry analyst firm in Barrington.\n\nPlanning and approvals for the Libertyville store, as well as for the landscaping and signage of the shopping center, were in progress well before the Trader Joe's announcement last February.\n\n\"Improvements are necessary to compete in today's marketplace,\" Cortesi said without directly addressing the competition, which also includes a Jewel-Osco store. He described Sunset as a \"very niched\" business noted for its high-end service, such as online shopping with curbside pickup and quality products.\n\nSunset shoppers can expect several changes as part of a three-month program scheduled to be completed by mid-August. The 52,000-square-foot store will remain open during the renovation.\n\nThe Liberty Tap craft beer and wine bar will complement the grill area on the west side of the store, according to Cortesi, and changes involving food display, service and offerings are coming.\n\n\"We see a lot of growth in the perishable (food) side of our business,\" he said. \"People are looking for gathering places.\"\n\nBuild your own cold sandwiches, a gourmet burger bar, a Graeter's ice cream shop, 12-kettle hot and cold soup self-service bar, and a custom cheese cutting station manned by a full-time cheese monger are among the additions.\n\n\"It's, I think, a big deal for Libertyville, if not unexpected,\" Hauptman said. \"Looking at it from an industry perspective, we see a lot of retailers doing what Sunset is doing.\"\n\nThe reason is clear, he added.\n\n\"If they don't do it, there are too many options for shoppers in an around Libertyville,\" Hauptman said.\n\nOne of them will be the California-based chain Trader Joe's, which is known for its eclectic atmosphere and varied selection of store brands and inexpensive wines. It is being built as part of a two-building retail development on the site of the former Frank's Nursery & Crafts, 1600 S. Milwaukee Ave. The construction value of the shell of the building and interior work for Trader Joe's is estimated at about $1.8 million.\n\nThe Libertyville location would be the second in Lake County, following Lake Zurich. There is no official date, but the company is on target to open this year, according to Alison Mochizuki, director of public relations. At 12,500 square feet, the Libertyville store is less than a quarter the size of Sunset.\n\n\"We consider ourselves a neighborhood grocery store,\" she said.\n\nThe big gun has been Mariano's, which twice has expanded parking since it opened two years ago because of continued demand.\n\n\"They are a major competitor in this market now for any traditional grocery store that exists,\" said John Kalmar, Vernon Hills' assistant village manager and point man for development. For example, the demise of the nearby Dominick's store, which closed in April 2012, was thought to have been hastened by the arrival of the 70,000-square-foot Mariano's.\n\n\"Trader Joe's has its niche, but we feel Mariano's will serve", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

Buckley assembled a band, composed of bassist Mick Grøndahl and drummer Matt Johnson, and spent several weeks rehearsing.[62][63]\n\nIn September, the trio headed to Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York to spend six weeks recording basic tracks for what would become Grace. Buckley invited ex-bandmate Lucas to play guitar on the songs \"Grace\" and \"Mojo Pin\", and Woodstock-based jazz musician Karl Berger wrote and conducted string arrangements with Buckley assisting at times.[64] Buckley returned home for overdubbing at studios in Manhattan and New Jersey where he performed take after take to capture the perfect vocals and experimented with ideas for additional instruments, and added textures to the songs.[65]\n\nIn January 1994, Buckley left to go on his first solo North American tour to support Live at Sin-é.[65] It was followed by a 10-day European tour in March.[66] Buckley played clubs and coffeehouses and made in-store appearances.[65] After returning, Buckley invited guitarist Michael Tighe to join the band and a collaboration between the two resulted in \"So Real\", a song which was recorded with producer/engineer Clif Norrell as a late addition to the album.[67][68] In June, Buckley began his first full band tour called the \"Peyote Radio Theatre Tour\" that lasted into August.[69] Pretender Chrissie Hynde,[70] Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, and The Edge from U2[71] were among the attendees of these early shows.\n\nHallelujah Grace from Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\nGrace was released on August 23, 1994. In addition to seven original songs, the album included three covers: \"Lilac Wine\", based on the version by Nina Simone;[53] made famous by Elkie Brooks, \"Corpus Christi Carol\", from Benjamin Britten's A Boy was Born, Op.3, a composition that Buckley was introduced to in high school, based on a 15th-century hymn;[72] and \"Hallelujah\"[73] by Leonard Cohen, based on John Cale's recording from the Cohen tribute album, I'm Your Fan.[53] His rendition of \"Hallelujah\" has been called \"Buckley's best\" and \"one of the great songs\"[74] by Time, and is included on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".[75]\n\nSales of Grace were slow, and it garnered little radio airplay despite critical acclaim.[76] The Sydney Morning Herald proclaimed it \"a romantic masterpiece\" and a \"pivotal, defining work\".[77] Despite slow initial sales the album went gold in France and Australia over the next two years,[69] achieving gold status in the U.S. in 2002,[78] and selling over six times platinum in Australia in 2006.[79]\n\nGrace won appreciation from a host of revered musicians and artists, including members of Buckley's biggest influence, Led Zeppelin.[80] Jimmy Page considered Grace close to being his \"favorite album of the decade\".[81] Robert Plant was also complimentary,[82] as was Brad Pitt, saying of Buckley's work, \"There's an undercurrent to his music, there's something you can't pinpoint. Like the best of films, or the best of art, there's something going on underneath, and there's a truth there. And I find his stuff absolutely haunting. It just ... it's under my skin.\"[83] Others who had influenced Buckley's music lauded him:[84] Bob Dylan named Buckley \"one of the great songwriters of this decade\",[82] and, in an interview with The Village Voice, David Bowie named Grace as one of 10 albums he'd bring with him to a desert island.[85] The album eventually went on to feature in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, appearing at No. 303.[86]\n\nConcert tours [ edit ]\n\nBuckley spent much of the next year and a half touring internationally to promote Grace. From the album's release, he played in numerous countries, from Australia, to the UK (Glastonbury Festival and the 1995 Meltdown Festival — at which he sang Henry Purcell's 'Dido's Lament'[87] — at the invitation of Elvis Costello).[88", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

To pay the school fees, his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably The Adolescent.\n\nYouth (1836–1843) Edit\n\nDostoevsky as a military engineer On 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of tuberculosis. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute, forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to the Academy in Reval, Estonia. Dostoevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend Konstantin Trutovsky once said, \"There was no student in the entire institution with less of a military bearing than F.M. Dostoevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a time and which lay heavily on him.\" Dostoevsky's character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption among officers and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname \"Monk Photius\". Signs of Dostoevsky's epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839, although the reports of a seizure originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by Sigmund Freud.[29]) which are now considered to be unreliable. His father's official cause of death was an apoplectic stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel Khotiaintsev, accused the father's serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to Siberia, Khotiaintsev would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in Tula, but Dostoevsky's brother Andrei perpetuated the story. After his father's death, Dostoevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval, and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling. On 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as \"no less good-natured and no less courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness\". Dostoevsky's first completed literary work, a translation of Honoré de Balzac's novel Eugénie Grandet, was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volume of the journal Repertoire and Pantheon,[34] followed by several other translations. None were successful, and his financial difficulties led him to write a novel.\n\nCareer Edit\n\nDeath Edit\n\nDostoevsky on his bier , drawing by Ivan Kramskoi, 1881 Dostoevsky's grave in Saint Petersburg On 25 January 1881, while searching for members of the terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya (\"The People's Will\") who would soon assassinate Tsar Alexander II, the Tsar's secret police executed a search warrant in the apartment of one of Dostoevsky's neighbours[citation needed]. On the following day, Dostoevsky suffered a pulmonary haemorrhage. Anna denied that the search had caused it, saying that the haemorrhage had occurred after her husband had been looking for a dropped pen holder.[f] After another haemorrhage, Anna called the doctors, who gave a poor prognosis. A third haemorrhage followed shortly afterwards. While seeing his children before dying, Dostoevsky requested that the parable of the Prodigal Son be read to his children. The profound meaning of this request is pointed out by Frank", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

(0:51)\n\nAfter questioning in December the logic of taking a pay cut from his $19.9 million cap number next season, defensive end Mario Williams has changed his tone on the issue.\n\nOn Wednesday, he told ESPN NFL Insider Josina Anderson that \"it's bigger than just the numbers\" and he would be open to listening to the Buffalo Bills about reducing his pay.\n\nThe Bills have the NFL's tightest salary-cap situation this offseason.\n\n\"I would love to have him back, but we'll see how realistic that is,\" coach Rex Ryan said Wednesday.\n\nThe Associated Press reported in December, citing a person with direct knowledge of discussions, that the Bills would release Williams this offseason. The Bills can save $12.9 million by releasing him.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, it all depends on what is happening,\" Williams told Anderson. \"My thing is this: Obviously, I've had big contracts, but once you get on a team and you get around the guys, it becomes family. The guys on defense, we laugh and talk about anything. We do a bunch of stuff together, and off the field, obviously. It's bigger than just numbers.\n\n\"But at the same time, as far as what you said about [a pay cut] being feasible, a [salary-cap] crunch is a crunch. Obviously there's two great players on the other side of the ball [pending free-agent left tackle Cordy Glenn and left guard Richie Incognito] that need to be back. Like you said, I'm not an accountant, either. I don't even know how you can go about making it where it makes at least some type of sense.\n\n\"That's not what I do, so that's why I don't even worry about it.\"\n\nMario Williams says he's willing to listen to the Bills about taking a pay cut to stay and is willing to meeting coaches halfway about his role in the defense. Stephen Pond/Getty Images\n\nWilliams, who is entering the fifth year of a six-year, $100 million deal he signed in 2012, has the second-highest cap number of any NFL defensive player next season. While the NFL has yet to determine its 2016 salary cap, ESPN Stats & Information projects the Bills to be about $1 million over their projected salary cap, making them the only team that must shed salary before the 2016 league year opens March 9.\n\nAsked after the Bills' Dec. 20 loss to the Washington Redskins if he would be open to taking a pay cut, Williams said, \"If this is the turnout of our defense, how does that even sound right?\"\n\nWilliams, 31, recorded 5.0 sacks this season, the lowest output of his career since his 4.5-sack performance as a rookie in 2006. Beginning in October, Williams expressed frustration to reporters about his role in Ryan's scheme, which sometimes had him dropping into coverage instead of rushing the quarterback.\n\nWilliams told Anderson that he would like to meet halfway with coaches on the issue.\n\n\"We didn't have -- at least I feel like for myself -- we didn't have common ground as far as give-and-take on the scheme,\" he said. \"I have no problem listening, but like I said, at least have us doing half of the snaps of what we do best, and that's us going [on attack] and the guys in the [secondary] can cover.\n\n\"Last year I feel like we were way more blitz-happy than anything. I'm just saying we can meet halfway, so the guys who get after the quarterback can get more opportunities to do that, and set up your fill with the players inside you and make it happen like that. That's all I ask. I'm not saying throw the scheme out. That's what I was saying before. I never said anything was wrong with the scheme.\"Bills coach Rex Ryan joins NFL Insiders and praises the character of DE Mario Williams, stating that he would like to have him back in Buffalo next season.

But after a proper groping, we're more excited than ever about Casio's new Bluetooth watch of the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unnamed plastic proof-of-concept may not be much to look at now, but after running through the BLE-infused prototype's features, we're definitely psyched to see the technology work its way into the rest of the company's timepieces.\n\nTo be clear: The watch really only does a few things. But it does them all exceedingly well. We tested it with an Android phone and connecting was as simple as pressing a button on watch. Whenever you receive a call, the watch instantly produces the name of the caller scrolling across the digital display. Double tapping the face mutes the call alarm saving you the trouble of frantically turning out your pockets or tearing through a bag.

{"id": "sample_7_94", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Average investors — those of us who don’t belong to an elite institutional class, for example — wanting to invest in a venture capital fund that supports emerging blockchain technologies will soon be able to do so.\n\nBlockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain technology companies, in collaboration with digital finance investment bank Argon Group, is about to issue its own Ethereum-based digital tokens called BCAP.\n\nThe move is part of a new liquidity-enhanced venture capital fund called Blockchain Capital III: a combination of a traditional limited partnership and the BCAP digital token, which will be sold in an upcoming initial token offering (ITO).\n\nBrock Pierce, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, believes that with this move they are “democratizing access to an asset class traditionally only available to elite institutional investors.”\n\nDemocratizing Venture Capitalism\n\nHere’s how it works. According to Pierce, Blockchain Capital is “providing the investor base across the globe with the opportunity to invest into a leading venture fund via a liquid, tradable, digital token.”\n\nTraditionally, venture fund investment has been restricted to an elite class of investors, including wealthy university endowments and politically connected unions and pension funds. These typical venture fund investments are also highly illiquid, locking up funds for terms as long as 10 years.\n\nDuring the initial token offering period, average investors who want to diversify and get exposure to the surging growth in blockchain startups can purchase BCAP tokens representing digital interests in the Blockchain Capital III VC fund, using bitcoin, ether or U.S. dollars.\n\nUnlike traditional VC fund investments with their 10-year terms, liquidity barriers are overcome since these tokens will soon be able to be bought and sold on secondary markets via established digital currency exchanges. Those exchange partnerships have yet to be announced but are in the works.\n\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, managing partner Bart Stephens explained that BCAP tokens follow the SEC exemptions for unregulated securities — the same structure as bonds and high-yield debt — under Regulation D, allowing them to be sold in the U.S., as well as Regulation S, allowing them to be sold internationally.\n\n“We’re playing within existing guidleines,” said Stephens, “but offering something new.”\n\nWalking the Blockchain Walk\n\nLaunched in 2013, Blockchain Capital’s initial fund was the first venture capital fund dedicated to the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem. It was also the first fund to accept capital calls in bitcoin.\n\nThe Argon Group, which is collaborating with Blockchain Capital on this initiative, is a major player in the emerging digital currency and token-based capital markets.\n\n“We are pioneering a groundbreaking moment in the history of venture capital by using blockchain technology to provide never-before-seen liquidity and access to investors,” said Stan Miroshnik, CEO of The Argon Group, to Bitcoin Magazine. “By investing in venture capital through a digital token, investors get liquidity, transparency, clear view on value and an ability to participate in an asset class previously reserved for elite institutions.”\n\nBlockchain Capital’s current portfolio is comprised of 43 unique companies from its prior two funds. These include Bitfury, BitGo, BitPesa, BlockCypher, Blockstream, Chain, Coinbase, Gem, GoCoin, itBit, PeerNova, Ripple, Wave and Xapo, among other blockchain technology leaders.\n\nThis investment focus of the new fund is expected to further Blockchain Capital’s established reputation of identifying outstanding blockchain technology companies led by ambitious management teams and partnering with them to accelerate growth.\n\n“I’ve never been more excited in my whole career,” said Stephens, an experienced fintech exective, hedge fund manager and venture capitalist. “We think it’s a great thing for the overall ecosystem. We think it’s a great thing for the hobby industry of venture capital. Venture capitalists like to talk about disruption and innovation but very few of them walk the walk. We are actually using blockchain technology to disrupt ourselves. It’s always a little uncomfortable but I’ve always said if we don’t do it someone else will.”\n\nFull details of the offering will be disclosed in the offering memorandum, which is expected to be published on April 3, 2017, via vctoken.com.Average investors — those of us who don’t belong to an elite institutional class, for example — wanting to invest in a venture capital fund that supports emerging blockchain technologies will soon be able to do so.\n\nBlockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in blockchain technology companies, in collaboration with digital finance investment bank Argon Group, is about to issue its own Ethereum-based digital tokens called BCAP.\n\nThe move is part of a new liquidity-enhanced", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_100", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874 – December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience. Together with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he identified several varieties of nerve fiber and established the relationship between action potential velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for these achievements.\n\nBiography [ edit ]\n\nErlanger was born on January 5, 1874, at San Francisco, California. His family was Jewish and his parents both immigrated from the Kingdom of Württemberg, Germany and met in California during the Gold Rush. Joseph was the sixth of seven children born to the couple. He completed his Bachelor of science in Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1895. He then completed his M.D. in 1899 from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, where he finished second in his class.\n\nUpon graduating, Erlanger interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital under William Osler and worked in a physiology laboratory. Erlanger also gave lectures at the school on digestion and metabolism. Erlanger also had an interest in cardiology, specifically the way that excitation transferred from the atrium to the ventricle and researched with Arthur Hirschfelder. Erlanger developed and patented a new type of sphygmomanometer that could measure blood pressure from the brachial artery. While working at Johns Hopkins in 1901, Erlanger published a paper on the digestive systems of canines. This paper caught the attention of William Henry Howell, a physiology professor at Johns Hopkins. Howell recruited Erlanger as an Assistant Professor. Erlanger was promoted to Associate Professor some time before 1906.\n\nIn 1906, Erlanger accepted a position as the first chair of physiology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. In 1910, he left to take a position as professor at Washington University in St. Louis; the St. Louis position offered Erlanger more funding for his projects. Herbert Spencer Gasser, Erlanger's former student at Wisconsin, joined Erlanger's laboratory soon after the move. During World War I, the pair contributed to the research effort examining the effects of shock. As part of this work, Erlanger was able to produce heart block in an animal model by clamping the bundle of His and tightening it.[4] Together, they managed to amplify the action potential of a bullfrog sciatic nerve in 1922 and published the results in the American Journal of Physiology. It is uncertain why the pair had such a sudden shift in interest to neuroscience, as Erlanger was already widely respected in the cardiology field.\n\nErlanger and Gasser were able to modify a Western Electric oscilloscope to run at low voltages. Prior to this modification, the only method available to measure neural activity was the electroencephalograph, which could only show large-scale electrical activity. With this technology, they were able to observe that action potentials occurred in two phases—a spike (initial surge) followed by an after-spike (a sequence of slow changes in potential). They discovered that neurons were found in many forms, each with their own potential for excitability. With this research, the pair discovered that the velocity of action potentials was directly proportional to the diameter of the nerve fiber. The partnership ended in 1931, when Gasser accepted a position at Cornell University. In 1944, they won the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for these discoveries.\n\nHe died of heart disease on December 5, 1965 at St. Louis, Missouri. The Joseph Erlanger House in St. Louis was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 8, 1976 as a building of national significance.[9] On January 22, 2009, the International Astronomical Union named a crater on the moon after him.[citation needed]\n\nCitations [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874 – December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience.

{"id": "sample_7_102", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " if you like politics— if you like America, dammit—it'll be tremendously fun to watch for several reasons.\n\nFor starters, it's going to be awkward. Christie and Booker are friends, as close as two politicians with identical aspirations can be. They don’t attack each other, they text all the time, and they shot an amusing parody video together. Over the summer they cut away from a party at the gubernatorial Jersey Shore house and took a stroll on the beach, just the two of them. They're even Facebook friends, having sat on Oprah Winfrey's couch last year and collected a $100 million investment from Mark Zuckerberg for Newark's schools. From education reform to a property tax cap, they have supported each other in a bipartisan way that is unfathomable in the nation’s capital.\n\nSecond, this will be Campaign 2.0. They may love a good TV interview, but Booker and Christie have drawn much of their popularity by circumventing traditional news and developing their own social-media channels for disseminating information. Booker has the second-most Twitter followers of any politician who hasn’t run for president and he recently cofounded a video-based social media company called Waywire. Christie, meanwhile, has amassed an online following from countless video clips, posted by his staff, of his dressing down journalists, constituents, Democrats, academic researchers and the New Jersey Supreme Court. YouTube against Twitter: Which is more effective?\n\nAnd finally, perhaps most importantly, the race represents a stark contrast in style. The mayor who meditates and quotes poetry versus the governor who…what's the opposite of meditation and poetry?\n\nBooker is a chameleon, able to give any audience what it needs. To the Florida delegation at the Democratic convention, for example, he dropped “Jesus Loves You” and the Hebrew equivalent, “Baruch Hashem,” in the same sentence, bringing black women and Jewish grandmothers to their feet. Christie, on the other hand, keeps his finger on the trigger—choosing respect, as he always says, before love. While Christie is a married father of four and the fattest national politician since the dawn of television, Booker is a fit, single man often dubbed “America’s sexiest mayor.” His sex life is of more than a little interest in political circles, and his name was appropriated for an erotic novel, “Cory’s Salvation.” He is crushed on by 20-something female progressives across the country, as evidenced by the question recently asked about him on Jezebel: “Is it hot in here or is that just the rising temperature of a million vaginas?”\n\nBooker, a vegetarian, often points to the contrast: “The governor is a Republican, I’m a Democrat. The governor likes steak, I like tofu. The governor is bold, I am bald. But we both recognize that we have common ground between us.”\n\nWhen the Klieg lights are turned on at the must-see debates next fall, though, don't expect the candidates to tread on such common ground. Christie will look to smash what one Republican operative described as Booker's “glass jaw” by attacking him for being the same kind of tax-and-spend Democrat that brought New Jersey the highest property taxes in the nation. He will say that Booker followed the playbook of his tarnished ally, former governor and bank boss Jon Corzine, by failing to address Newark’s structural deficit and continued reliance on suburban taxes. Like Democrats in Congress who ignore the cost of entitlements, Christie will argue, Booker failed to do the “big things.”\n\nChristie’s been to war before as a federal prosecutor, challenger to Corzine, and chief surrogate for Romney. Booker won his mayorship in a nasty race against a longtime state senator, but he's the relative newbie on the national scene. So he will first try to deflect Christie's shots with some of the platitudes he peddles on Twitter. Failing that, he will follow the advice of the focus groups and attempt to exploit Christie's gender gap by repeatedly bringing up the governor's opposition to abortion and gay marriage. He will frame these as civil rights matters, then go for the gut by questioning Christie's blue-collar-hero status—that the governor reduced a tax credit for the working poor, while vetoing taxes for millionaires.\n\nMost of all, Booker will wait for the inevitable insult, some word that Christie lets slip that a few thousand independent voters think goes too far. This isn't a state where we want our leaders calling lawmakers “numbnuts” and Navy SEALs “idiots,” as Christie has done. Booker will wait for that gaffe, and then let it simmer.

{"id": "sample_7_107", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "SAN FRANCISCO – A new edition of an international space exploration planning document to be released early next year will offer an updated plan for human missions to the moon and Mars, emphasizing the role that NASA’s proposed Deep Space Gateway could play.\n\nIn January, NASA and 14 international space agencies plan to publish their common goals for exploration, including an extended presence in low Earth orbit, a cislunar habitat, moon missions and eventual excursions to Mars, in an updated Global Exploration Roadmap being drafted by the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG).\n\nSince NASA’s first flight of its heavy-lift Space Launch System with an Orion capsule is scheduled for as soon as late 2019, it’s time to decide “what we are going to do with these vehicles,” Kathy Laurini, NASA senior adviser for exploration and space operations, said during a Global Exploration Roadmap community workshop at the NASA Ames Research Center Nov. 29. “We’ve been engaged with our international partners on how we’ll use these to explore together.”\n\nISECG, a voluntary organization whose members share non-binding plans and objectives, published its last Global Exploration Roadmap in 2013. ISECG members will use the new Roadmap to show domestic policymakers and funding agencies how specific programs will contribute to global endeavors, said Laurini, who also serves as ISECG chair.\n\nNASA, for example, will point to the roadmap as it seeks funding and authorization for future SLS and Orion missions. NASA officials acknowledged, though, that the agency is waiting for confirmation of a new administrator and direction from the National Space Council. Future exploration plans will become clearer when the Trump Administration and Congress weigh in on the agency’s budget, said Mark Geyer, acting deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Human Explorations and Operations Mission Directorate.\n\nNASA also is seeking domestic and international support for its conceptual Deep Space Gateway. “We see an orbital platform as playing a vital and synergistic role with anything you do on the surface,” said John Guidi, NASA advanced exploration systems deputy director. For instance, reusable landers could move astronauts to the Deep Space Gateway, which could also serve as a jumping off point for exploration of near Earth asteroids and Mars. “Cislunar orbit is the sweet spot. It’s close enough to Earth and the moon but out of the gravity wells,” Guidi said.\n\nIn the new Roadmap, ISECG will emphasize a shared commitment in the next 10 to 15 years to continue operations in low Earth orbit, where space agencies can conduct microgravity research and test life support systems for future exploration missions. Some of that work, though, may occur in new public or private space stations rather than the International Space Station.\n\nThe ISS partners have agreed to keep funding the space station through 2024. To date, NASA and its international partners have been able to maintain the aging space station with spare parts. However, older components, including the solar arrays, will need to be replaced by the end of the 2020s, said Robyn Gatens, deputy director of NASA’s ISS Division. Even if the ISS partners do not make commitments to support it beyond 2024, the transition from space station to another platform should be gradual, Gatens added.\n\nThe new Roadmap lays out a three-phase plan. The starting point, Phase 0, is ongoing research and testing on ISS. During Phase 1 in the 2020s, international agencies would explore the lunar vicinity. In that timeframe, NASA would work with partners to construct the Deep Space Gateway, a crewed outpost with less than 10 percent of the habitable volume of ISS, and agencies would send robotic missions to the lunar surface and prepare for human lunar exploration. By Phase 2 in the 2030s, agencies would send exploration missions to orbit Mars.\n\nUnder current budget projections, NASA could launch one crewed SLS/Orion flight per year, with each Orion spending approximately 40 days at the Deep Space Gateway, Guidi said. Four SLS missions in the 2020s could assemble elements of the Deep Space Gateway, including its power and propulsion bus, habitat, logistics module and airlock, Guidi said.\n\nISECG shared its draft Roadmap to encourage companies, government agencies and academic organizations to offer comments. “The Deep Space Gateway is a concept for government-led exploration endeavors,” Laurini said. “It is a commitment to being there. And because we are there, it will offer opportunities for commercial entities.”\n\nThose commercial opportunities, ISECG partners believe, include playing key roles in delivering cargo to the Deep Space Gateway, relaying communications from the lunar surface, sending instruments to the surface of the moon to support government investigations of volatile organic compounds and transporting cargo to the moon to support crews spending time there.SAN FRANCISCO – A new edition of an international", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

If you are using Python for the entire layout does it become difficult to understand the overall circuit without the visual representation? Is there a way to generate a circuit diagram from the SKIDL code for a visual reference?\n\nIt seems that there is a substantial amount of electrical knowledge required to be able to design and build schematics in code. For someone who is more of a hobbyist or is just starting to work with circuit design are there any facilities of SKIDL to assist with that understanding?\n\nWhat does the testing and validation process of a generated circuit look like?\n\nWhat does the internal architecture of SKIDL look like and what are some of the biggest challenges that you have faced while building it?\n\nFor the generated netlist does SKIDL take into account voltage losses due to the lengths of the traces in the final PCB and does it have any facilities to optimize the overall layout for space and efficiency?\n\nSometimes a circuit board is meant to be accessible for maintenance or even display purposes. Is it possible to specify the arrangement of components to make them more aesthetically pleasing or to space them so that they are easier to access physical interface ports (e.g. GPIO pins or I2C buses)?\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or surprising uses of SKIDL that you have seen?\n\nKeep In Touch\n\nPicks\n\nTobias Samsonite Tectonic Backpack\n\nDave Ball 4 by Jim Bouton\n\nLinks\n\nThe intro and outro music is from Requiem for a Fish The Freak Fandango Orchestra / CC BY-SASummary\n\nAs circuits and electronic components become more complex, visual circuit building tools are more difficult to use effectively.

After just eight plays, he hit the stop button on his remote control.\n\n\"Get him in here,\" Wannstedt said. \"If he is the type of person we want, we will offer him a scholarship.\"\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nLewis replaced McCoy the following year, breaking McCoy's record for most points by a Pitt freshman and breaking Tony Dorsett's record for most rushing yards by a freshman in the Big East.\n\nIt did not take long to see Lewis had special talent.\n\n\"Barry Sanders was the quickest I ever saw in terms of making a guy miss in a hole,\" Wannstedt said. \"Dion isn't Barry Sanders, but he had some of that same make-a-guy-miss-in-a hole quickness. Plus he had 4.5 speed to outrun you. He could catch. He did things you can't coach.\"\n\nLewis was about more than just quick feet. Buddy Morris, the strength coach for Pitt at the time, gave his players a test that measured pound-for-pound strength. Morris said Lewis bench-pressed twice his body weight and squatted more than 500 pounds, making him the strongest pound-for-pound player on the team.\n\nClue No. 2: There was a reason many overlooked Lewis\n\nAt the 2011 scouting combine, Lewis measured 5'7\" and weighed 193 pounds. Those numbers spoke loudly to NFL ears. Despite his stats at Pitt, including once carrying the ball 47 times in a single game, Lewis would not be considered durable enough to be an every-down NFL back.\n\nLewis' small frame did not diminish the enthusiasm of Joe Banner, then the president of the Eagles. The loudest voice in the Philadelphia draft room pushing for the team to select Lewis was Banner's. But even he had tempered expectations. He thought Lewis would be a change-of-pace back in the NFL. The Eagles subsequently targeted Lewis as a fifth-round pick, and they were pleased to select him there.\n\n\"There is a prejudice in the NFL against smaller players, and for good reason,\" said Banner, now an ESPN analyst. \"Most smaller players don't overcome the size challenge. But that stereotypical thinking cost a lot of teams a chance at a guy with a lot of talent. He is a good example of that.\"\n\nSmaller running backs almost always are backups in the NFL. And most coaches want backups to have special teams value. Lewis has not been a return man, and he isn't big enough to block or play coverage on special teams.\n\nLewis understands his lack of size has cost him opportunities.\n\n\"Some people might not want a smaller back on their team, but I don't think of it that way,\" he said. \"I've always been one of the smaller guys on my team, my whole life, so I'm used to it. I knew what I wanted to do and I wasn't going to let anybody tell me I couldn't do something.\"\n\nClue No. 3: Lewis was held back by circumstance\n\nLewis just wasn't in the right place at the right time early in his career.\n\nThe Eagles weren't right. Lewis' arrival in Philadelphia coincided with McCoy's arrival as a premier back. In 2011, Lewis' rookie season, McCoy led the NFL in touchdowns and was voted First Team All-Pro. He took 73 percent of the running back touches that year.\n\n\"When Dion had opportunities, he was outstanding,\" said Marty Mornhinweg, who was the Eagles offensive coordinator. \"But he was behind LeSean.\"\n\nMichael Perez/Associated Press\n\nThe following season, Lewis stayed behind McCoy and fell behind two rookies—Bryce Brown, who checked in at 5'11\", 223, and Chris Polk, who was 5'11\", 222. It did not help that Banner, who had been Lewis' football godfather, had been phased out in Philadelphia.\n\nBanner went from Philadelphia to Cleveland, and one of his first moves was to call the Eagles to ask if they would trade Lewis. Banner acquired Lewis a second time in a deal for linebacker Emmanuel Acho.\n\nThe Browns weren't right, either. Lewis appeared to be on the verge of breaking out in Cleveland the summer of 2013. Then he fractured his fibula in the second preseason game.\n\n\"I would say he was going to play a great deal if he had not been injured,\" said Norv Turner, who was the Browns offensive coordinator that year. \"After [the Browns traded] Trent Richardson [in September], Dion would have", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_7_113", "config_id": 7, "prompt": ", it happened. Rich Cho and Michael Jordan selected the nineteen-year-old, from the Kentucky Wildcats over the likes of Donovan Mitchell, Luke Kennard, and Bam Adebayo. In fact, in a poll that was run among Hornets fans before the draft (where 227 total votes were tallied), 27 percent of fans agreed the Hornets should trade up for Monk, while 70 percent agreed that Charlotte should take him if available. In fact, only three percent of Hornets fans would have picked another player over Monk (seven total votes).\n\nIt was a pick out of the ordinary. It wasn’t a ‘Charlotte’ pick. It shattered the stereotypes of the Hornets always picking big, white, unathletic centers. Monk, when asked to describe his own game in one word, said, “Electric”. As you can tell by his own response, this is not the typical Charlotte first round pick. When you think of a Hornets’ draft pick (before the 2017 NBA Draft), your thought probably floats around three ideas. A lengthy defensive guard, a grit-and-grind wing, or a defensive center. Malik Monk fits into none of the above.\n\nHowever, disappointment struck after Monk missed Orlando Summer League with an ankle injury sustained in a pre-draft workout. Recovery took longer than expected, but Monk eventually made his debut in the preseason. He performed well, averaging 16 points, three rebounds, and two assists, managing to only turn the ball over once per game, and more importantly, remaining healthy. As if the expectations were not already high, this raised the bar another degree. But many forget that preseason is, well, the only preseason.\n\nIn the regular season, Monk has been streaky to say the least. Other than a few games, he has been a below average role player. His best scoring outbreak came against the Milwaukee Bucks on November 1st. He scored 25 points on 10-17 shooting, most of which came in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe is also currently one of the worst defensive players in the NBA. He ranks in the bottom 29 percent in points per possession allowed, giving up almost a full point (0.96) points per possession when his man shoots the ball. Monk also struggles to defend spot-up shooters. He ranks in the bottom nine percent, allowing a full 1.296 points per possession when his man is spotting up. This isn’t good. Considering Clifford’s defense-first mentality, this stat alone makes the fact that Monk minutes are disappearing not surprising.\n\nThat said, rookies often struggling defensively, and most teams that do actually have a top rookie don’t have any players to play above their selected player. For instance, Lauri Markkanen of the Chicago Bulls has been just plain bad on defense this season. However, what separates him from Monk are a few different factors. First of all, Markkanen has been the main scoring threat on a team that many would consider, the worst in the NBA. The Bulls aren’t exactly a playoff threat (despite beating the Hornets now twice).\n\nIt’s important to remember that the Hornets are in a win-now-or-everybody-might-be-fired mode. Cho is in a contract year, and Steve Clifford is on the hot seat. This is part of the reason that Monk will a) not start many, if not any games this season, or b) get many minutes when he does actually play. It’s all about circumstance.\n\nMonk is the team’s third-best shooting guard behind Nicolas Batum and sixth-man Jeremy Lamb. When a team is trying to win games, they do not exactly want their third-best shooting guard playing more than 20 minutes per game.\n\nHowever, there is an argument that Monk could play point-guard instead. When Michael Carter-Williams was out with an injury to start the season, Monk played backup to Kemba Walker, and even showed off some flashy passes and nice vision as well. And with the way MCW has been playing recently, there is definitely a solid argument to play Monk over him. But once again, when a borderline playoff team is trying to play with the big dogs, playing a nineteen-year-old with little point guard experience over experienced players is not ideal. In fact, it's a wildcard move. It is not a Steve Clifford-esque move.\n\nLet’s compare Monk’s efficiency to Lamb, Batum, and Carter-Williams.\n\nFG% of Active Hornet Guards Name FG% 3P% FT% eFG% Name FG% 3P% FT% eFG% Nic Batum 44% 36% 84% 52% Jeremy Lamb 44% 33% 83% 50% Malik Monk 34% 33% 75% 44% Michael Carter-Williams 40% 25% 70% 31.00%\n\nAs you can see, if", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

It looks like DSK's dream of dethroning the dollar as the de facto \"international currency\" was beginning to gain momentum. (Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has said that the transition from dollars to SDRs \"could be phased in within the next year.\") But didn't he know that his actions would anger some very powerful and well-connected people?\n\nWell, if he did; he never let on. In fact, he started mucking around in other stuff, too, like when he intervened on behalf of Irish taxpayers, trying to protect them at the expense of foreign bondholders. That's a big \"No no\" in banker's world. They keep a list of \"people who count\", and taxpayers are not on that list. Here's an excerpt from the Irish Times:\n\n\"Ireland’s Last Stand began less shambolically than you might expect. The IMF, which believes that lenders should pay for their stupidity before it has to reach into its pocket, presented the Irish with a plan to haircut €30 billion of unguaranteed bonds by two-thirds on average. (Irish finance minister) Lenihan was overjoyed, according to a source who was there, telling the IMF team: “You are Ireland’s salvation.”\n\nThe deal was torpedoed from an unexpected direction. At a conference call with the G7 finance ministers, the haircut was vetoed by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner who, as his payment of $13 billion from government-owned AIG to Goldman Sachs showed, believes that bankers take priority over taxpayers. The only one to speak up for the Irish was UK chancellor George Osborne, but Geithner, as always, got his way. An instructive, if painful, lesson in the extent of US soft power, and in who our friends really are.\n\nThe negotiations went downhill from there. On one side was the European Central Bank, unabashedly representing Ireland’s creditors and insisting on full repayment of bank bonds. On the other was the IMF, arguing that Irish taxpayers would be doing well to balance their government’s books, let alone repay the losses of private banks.\" (\"Ireland's future depends on breaking free from bailout\", Morgan Kelly, Irish Times)\n\nSo, Strauss-Kahn stuck up for Irish taxpayers over the banks, the bondholders, the ECB, and the US Treasury. Naturally, that made him persona non grata among the ruling throng.\n\nAnd, there's more, too, because Strauss-Kahn's vision was not limited to currency alone, but involved broad structural changes to the IMF itself that would have reversed decades of neoliberal policies. DSK had settled on a new approach to policymaking; one that would abandon the worst elements of globalization and put greater emphasis on social cohesion, cooperation and multilateralism. Here's an excerpt from the speech titled \"Human Development and Wealth Distribution\" he gave in November 2010:\n\n\"....Adam Smith—one of the founders of modern economics—recognized clearly that a poor distribution of wealth could undermine the free market system, noting that: “The disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful and…neglect persons of poor and mean condition…is the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments.”\n\nThis was over 250 years ago. In today’s world, these problems are magnified under the lens of globalization....globalization also had a dark side. Lurking behind it was a large and growing chasm between rich and poor—especially within countries. An inequitable distribution of wealth can wear down the social fabric. More unequal countries have worse social indicators, a poorer human development record, and higher degrees of economic insecurity and anxiety. In too many countries, inequality increased and real wages stagnated—failing to keep up with productivity—over the past few decades. Ominously, inequality in the United States was back at its pre-Great Depression levels on the eve of the crisis....\n\nAn immediate task is to end the scourge of unemployment....Progressive taxation can also promote equity through redistribution, and this should be encouraged....“Inequality is corrosive” ....“it rots societies from within…it illustrates and exacerbates the loss of social cohesion…the pathology of the age and the greatest threat to the health of any democracy.” (\"Human Development and Wealth Distribution\", Dominique Strauss-Kahn, IMF)\n\nCan you believe it? DSK is lecturing bankers about redistribution? That's not what they want to hear. What they want to hear is why ripping off poor people actually makes the world a better place. DSK's speech just shows that he wasn't drinking the Koolaid anymore.", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_120", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " is the intensity of the animus against her, and the sad mountain of baggage she carries with her as a candidate.\n\nNo matter who the GOP nominee is, the battle plan against Hillary will be the same: a tawdry and unrelenting relitigation of all the phony scandals cooked up by the “vast, right-wing conspiracy” that she identified nearly two decades ago.\n\nCue up the Pearl Jam, folks, because we’re going all the way back to the '90s: Whitewater, Travelgate, Troopergate, Lewinskygate, with a little Vince Foster Murdergate, for a dash of blood. But wait—those are just the golden oldies! You’ll also be hearing about the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Pardons. Of course, what respectable slander campaign would be complete without the new material? Benghazi, the private email server, the Wall Street speeches?\n\nThe dark corporate money and talented propagandists aligned against Hillary will make the Swift Boat Veterans look like toy soldiers.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAnd because our Fourth Estate is driven at this point almost entirely by the desperate promotion of scandal narratives and conflict, every one of these paid attacks will be amplified by so-called free media, or what us starry-eyed hippies used to call journalism.\n\nI’m not blaming Hillary for this sad state of affairs. I’m just trying to be—what’s the word I’m looking for? Ah yes, here it is—realistic about how it’s going to go down.\n\nRepublicans tend to lose when they have to talk in specific terms about policies, priorities and solutions. They win when elections are reduced to brawls and/or personality contests. (See Reagan/Carter, Bush/Kerry, et al.)\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut if Donald Trump is the nominee, as seems most likely right now, he will also enjoy two genuine lines of attack against Hillary.\n\nThe first is the same one Bernie just used to upset her in Michigan: the fact that free trade pacts are wildly unpopular with many Americans. Trump has been full-throated (and, as usual, somewhat full of shit) in his condemnation of free trade, and it has been one of his most successful pitches. You can bet your bottom yen that he’ll hammer Hillary on this, as if she personally whipped votes for NAFTA. He’ll excoriate various forms of crony capitalism (deals cut with big pharma, bogus military contracts, etc.) that Democrats such as Hillary either endorsed or enabled through timidity. And he’ll blast her for backing our trillion-dollar boondoggle in Iraq, too.\n\nThese accusations will be framed in terms of a larger narrative: that Hillary represents business as usual in Washington, that she’s just another career pol beholden to the donor class and to the Wall Street swells who paid her millions to deliver her secret speeches.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTrump may be a sexually insecure adolescent with a penchant for inciting racial violence, but the one undeniable aspect of his appeal is that he recognizes the toxic nature of the status quo and will, by sheer force of personality, bring it down.\n\nThis promise is about as flimsy as a Trump University diploma. But it’s resonating with voters who feel Washington’s carnival of corruption is beyond redemption.\n\nAll of which brings us back to that credulous waif from Brooklyn, by way of Ben and Jerry’s. Donald Trump can holler all he wants about how Crazy Bernie is a socialist. But he (and the super Pacs) won’t be able to distract voters by digging up scandals in his past. Nor will Trump be able to portray him as a corporate stooge.\n\nIn fact, the shocking success of the Sanders campaign is predicated on many of the same essential frustrations Trump is exploiting: corporate influence, wage stagnation, trade. This is why polls consistently show Sanders beating Trump more convincingly than Clinton does.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe right wing knows how to go after Hillary, because they’ve been doing so for 30 years. Within the media and a significant portion of the electorate, the neural pathways have already been carved out. Hillary is defensive, programmed, ethically suspect.\n\nThey are going to have a more difficult time smearing a candidate whose biggest liabilities are his “extreme” policy positions, most of which sound more like a common sense corrective to the excesses of capitalism. Higher taxes on corporations and the super-wealthy? Healthcare as a right? A higher minimum wage? Increased funding for education and infrastructure? Good luck demonizing those positions, Big Donald.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that Hillary won’t beat Trump, if they wind up as the nominees. Nor that she won’t be", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_142", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "One of the strangest sentences in American law comes from Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. “Under the First Amendment,” he wrote, in 1974, “there is no such thing as a false idea.” That is not a decree that the world brims with truth. He meant that we rely on the marketplace of ideas, rather than on judges and juries, to sort out truth from falsehood—and to continually check our understanding of the truth. The Justice was restating the central tenet embraced in New York Times v. Sullivan, in 1964, the Supreme Court’s most important decision about freedom of speech and of the press. The Court extended the scope of the First Amendment to libel law and held that, even if a citizen stated or a newspaper published criticism about a public official that was incorrect, that mistake could be punished as libel only if the critic knew or suspected that the criticism was false. In 1967, the Court applied this rule to public figures as well.\n\nThe premise of the marketplace applies broadly, not just to libel law. The First Amendment protects a lot of harmful speech, including much that is incendiary, offensive, and untrue. That protection covers President Trump, even if he does not believe the torrent of falsehoods he has uttered. Experts on crowd size estimate that his Inauguration attracted a crowd of about a hundred and fifty thousand, but Trump is free to say that there were as many as a million and a half people there. Public officials who oversaw the 2016 election reported that there were scant numbers of votes cast illegally—virtually none compared to the more than 137.7 million ballots cast in total—but Trump can claim that, had it not been for massive voter fraud, he would have won the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by 2.9 million votes, or 2.1 per cent of the total.\n\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes introduced this concept into American law almost a century ago, writing that “the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.” That includes Trump’s views that journalists are “among the most dishonest human beings on Earth” and “the enemy of the American people,” and that the federal appeals-court ruling that struck down his first travel ban, a month ago, jeopardized the security of the country.\n\nA wide body of scholarship has poked holes in Holmes’s idea. Fifty years ago, Jerome A. Barron, of George Washington University Law School, instructed that the marketplace fails because it assumes incorrectly that all citizens have access to it, that truth is always among the ideas in the marketplace, and that citizens are rational and will see the truth, rather than being irrational or simply subjective.\n\nFrederick Schauer, of the University of Virginia, summarized the case against the marketplace concept: “placing faith in the superiority of truth” to persuade—over the authority of a speaker, the frequency with which he makes an assertion, the consistency between the assertion and what a listener believes, and other factors, such as whether an assertion is illustrated or not—requires “an almost willful disregard of the masses of scientific and marketing research to the contrary.” (Elizabeth Kolbert wrote last month about new cognitive research that shows the limits of reason.) Schauer wrote that the belief that “a good remedy for false speech is more speech, or that truth will prevail in the long run, may itself be an example of the resistance of false factual propositions to argument and counterexample.”\n\nThese days, the most obvious problem with the notion of a marketplace of ideas is balkanization: instead of there being an overarching marketplace where truth can vanquish falsehood, there are at least two very separate markets—“filter bubbles,” as Amanda Hess described them in the Times—for Trump supporters and opponents, resulting from “the tendency of social networks like Facebook and Twitter to lock users into personalized feedback loops, each with its own news sources, cultural touchstones and political inclinations.”\n\nThere is also the problem that some bubbles are more counterfactual than others. This was clear from the proliferation of bogus news in support of the Trump campaign, like what came out of the Macedonian town of Veles, with its “100 pro-Trump websites, many of them filled with sensationalist, utterly fake news,” during the Presidential election, as Wired reported. That counterfeit content “energized Trump’s partisans,” the scholars Michael C. Dorf and Sidney Tarrow wrote recently, “and may have been decisive in securing Trump’s victory.”One of the strangest sentences in American law comes from Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. “Under the First Amendment,” he wrote, in 1974, “there is no such thing as a false idea.” That is not a decree that", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_7_143", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Speaking to a room full of veterans Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump seemed to suggest soldiers who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) aren't strong.\n\n\"When people come back from war and combat and they see maybe what the people in this room have seen many times over, and you’re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it,\" Trump said, via Buzzfeed News.\n\nThe comments, which reportedly were greeted by a silence over the room, came during a question-and-answer session with the Retired American Warriors Pac. Some on social media were quick to criticize the GOP nominee for the comments\n\nTrump reportedly made the PTSD comments just after saying 22 veterans commit suicide every day, using an often-cited, but outdated figure from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The department updated that figure this year, saying it was closer to 20 suicides per day. Trump mentioned Monday that his plan for the VA would allow veterans to receive care at any hospital and not just at VA clinics, which he said are overwhelmed with long lines.\n\n\"People are killing themselves what are waiting on line because they have days and days before what could be a simple procedure, a simple prescription, and the wait is so long, they can’t take it,\" Trump said, according to Buzzfeed.\n\nTrump previously stumbled talking with veterans when he criticized in July 2015 the service of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. \"He's not a war hero,\" Trump said. \"He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.\" Trump received a number of deferments from serving in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe GOP nominee has registered a fair amount of support among the military. A September survey from the Military Times and Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families found Trump registered 37.6 percent among the entire military force, followed by Libertarian Gary Johnson at 36.5 percent and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 16.3 percent.Speaking to a room full of veterans Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump seemed to suggest soldiers who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) aren't strong.\n\n\"When people come back from war and combat and they see maybe what the people in this room have seen many times over, and you’re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can’t handle it,\" Trump said, via Buzzfeed News.\n\nThe comments, which reportedly were greeted by a silence over the room, came during a question-and-answer session with the Retired American Warriors Pac.

Some on social media were quick to criticize the GOP nominee for the comments\n\nTrump reportedly made the PTSD comments just after saying 22 veterans commit", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_146", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " game, which I’m slightly grateful for. As I didn’t see an English/Japanese toggle I was initially worried it was going to force me to play with an English voice cast, but nope, it’s all Japanese unless I’ve really missed something. This does make the subtitle option a little redundant, though, unless you really don’t like understanding what’s happening, or you just want to take pretty screenshots without text cluttering them up. If there is a downside, it’s that not everything is subtitled; little combat barks and lines that NPCs say when you’re wandering around hub areas go completely ignored by the translation fairy.\n\nThen we get to Controls, and things dive faster than someone whose Manoeuvre Gear just ran out of fuel.\n\nShort version: there is no mouse support at all. Long version: not only is there no mouse support at all, but the keys are mapped in such a way that you will require more hands than the average human being possesses to play. It’s the usual “map the sticks to WASD and the arrow keys, and then map the buttons to JIKL and some other random shit” that requires you to have 30 fingers. Not only that, but WASD defaults to the camera control rather than the movement.\n\nYou do appear to be able to rebind this shit, but seriously, I would not recommend playing this on keyboard. Not unless you are actually an octopus, anyway, and if that’s the case then well done on learning to read this website, and congratulations on having the taste to be interested in Attack on Titan. As a member of a species with opposable thumbs, I’m proud of you.\n\nThe game itself looks fairly nice and swoops along at 60FPS, so that’s a plus. It’s got the usual pseudo-cel-shaded anime-in-3D look which works nicely, and effort has even gone into the cutscenes, with all of them being redone in the game’s 3D engine rather than just copy/pasting bits of the anime directly into the game. While the anime arguably does them better, this does mean things are cut down nicely and kept fairly short and to the point. I can’t decide what framerate the cutscenes run at, though: they appear to be pre-recorded stuff that’s running at 30FPS, but FRAPS tells me that it’s still hopping along at 60FPS. It might be going at 60 but be slowed down a little from the game engine, or it may be that it’s a 30FPS movie while the game is still clocking along at 60. Either way, I don’t think it’s going to impinge your enjoyment anyway.\n\nOn the downside, there is some horrific tearing. At least, I think it’s tearing, but it feels more like the refresh rate isn’t quite right, almost as though scan lines are appearing partway down the screen for some reason. Mercifully, this mostly hit me in the hub areas rather than in actual gameplay, but be forewarned. I’ll be carrying on playing the game for awhile so if this gets worse or vanishes, I’ll update you.\n\nLoading times are also pretty good, even without doing my usual ritual of defragging the game folder after installation. Any initial load-up took around 15 seconds, but once it had everything nicely cached, future loads took about three. I could go back to the main menu and switch to a different game mode and it still loaded stupidly fast. So hey, that’s pretty great.\n\nLess great is that it’s crashed once already in just under two hours of play time. I’m sort of hoping that’s an outlier rather than an indication of things to come, but be warned.\n\nAttack on Titan: Wings of Freedom, basically, is a pretty bare-bones but functional port. There are keyboard controls that are utterly cursory and nobody should ever, ever, ever use them; there are graphical options that make a difference but aren’t particularly in-depth; it runs at 60FPS and 1920×1080 resolution; it has a weird hatred of all operating systems past Windows 7 but that hasn’t caused any notable problems.\n\nI am, however, enjoying the game itself; considering it’s all about aerial control and swooping towards big targets that can kill you with incredible ease, Attack on Titan seems to have managed to balance ease of use with some depth to the control mastery.\n\nMovement is mostly handled by tapping X to shunk out your manoeuvre gear anchors and swing yourself through the sky, and this is definitely based more on direction than it is on", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

No advertising, no special sales, no marketing.\n\nYet ever since 1968 Gregor Terjung has made his Terjung's Studio of Gifts in the West Seattle Junction a success. Now 87, he says he's thinking about retirement noting that he has a son in law that retired at 65. But that day is a ways off, since for he and his daughter Gail, the shop is a labor of love.\n\nCompeting in a world seemingly dominated by digital sales would seem next to impossible, but the store relies on the power of immediacy (no waiting for delivery), sentiment (most of the items in the store are meant to be given from one person to another, not sent via truck), and relationships. Not just between his customers and their families and friends but with the community at large.\n\nTerjung has such a long history, that the vast majority of his customers are people who have shopped with him for decades.\n\nHe's been in business for 48 years.\n\nAt Terjung's you will find a huge assortment of greeting cards from eight different vendors, small toys, items for baby showers, wedding showers, ribbon, candies, a good sized selection of small stuffed animals, an assortment of marmalades and tea accessories, and surprisingly, a selection of magic tricks and magic DVD's to train the budding magician.\n\nThe store also has some hand made aprons and tiny gift boxes that are unique to Terjung's because they are things he made himself.\n\nIt's a store primarily based on the heart to heart communication between family, friends and loved ones.\n\nSomehow, clicking on a website to buy something and have it shipped lacks that personal touch. It's likely why Terjung's has not just survived but thrived.\n\nHe was in the Army, serving at Fort Lewis, joining in 1948 when he graduated High School and \"missed everything\" meaning the gap between the end of World War II and the Korean conflict was his service window. He met his wife of 67 years, Gloria in Seattle through a friend who had moved here. She does the bookwork for the store at home. His secret to a good marriage is to \"just try to get along, She has a temper and I don't so when she gets mad I just walk away and the next day she's fine and we're ok.\"\n\n\"We just love what we do, and we love our customers,\" he said, \"Now we see some new customers from the new apartments, and they become repeat customers.\"\n\nThe business actually began in a garage in the Fauntleroy neighborhood and was started by Mrs. Walbum, she later moved it to the Junction in the late 1950's. Gregor had worked for Safeway and then pursued his ambition to get into lithography and sold her some things. He bought the business from her in 1968. Gail joined him 37 years ago and now does all the buying. Sister Gina also comes in on Fridays to help out.Gregor Terjung is 87 and has been coming to his West Seattle junction store nearly every day since he bought the business in 1968.\n\nPatrick Robinson\n\nNo website, no Facebook page, not even an email account.

But that day is a ways off, since for he and his daughter Gail, the shop is a labor of love.\n\nCompeting in a world seemingly dominated by digital sales would seem next to impossible, but the store relies on the power of immediacy (no waiting for delivery), sentiment (most of the items in the store are meant to be given from one person to another, not sent via truck), and relationships. Not just between his customers and their families and friends but with the community at large.\n\nTerjung has such a long history, that the vast majority of his customers are people who have shopped with him for decades.\n\nHe's been in business for 48 years.\n\nAt Terjung's you will find a huge assortment of greeting cards from eight different vendors, small toys, items for baby showers, wedding showers, ribbon, candies, a good sized selection of small stuffed animals, an assortment of marmalades and tea accessories, and surprisingly, a selection of magic tricks and magic DVD's to train the budding magician.\n\nThe store also has some hand made aprons and tiny gift boxes that are unique to Terjung's because they are things he", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_7_164", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Steven Salaita speaks at the Maryland AAUP’s conference on academic freedom, at John Hopkins University, 25 April. Mike Ferguson AAUP\n\nSteven Salaita will not be reinstated under the terms of an out of court settlement with the University of Illinois.\n\nThe deal will pay Salaita $875,000 – about ten times the annual salary he would have received as a tenured professor in the American Indian Studies program at the university’s flagship Urbana-Champaign campus.\n\n“This settlement is a vindication for me, but more importantly, it is a victory for academic freedom and the First Amendment,” Salaita said in a release from his legal counsel, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the law firm Loevy & Loevy.\n\nThe settlement brings an end to Salaita’s breach of contract lawsuit against university trustees and administrators over his August 2014 firing because of his tweets excoriating Israel’s attack on Gaza.\n\nSalaita had sought reinstatement as well as financial damages.\n\nThe terms of the deal will come as a surprise to some supporters. His lawyers had said all along that Salaita was willing to settle, but that his primary goal would be to get his job back.\n\nThe university has been adamant, however, that it would not allow him into the classroom.\n\n“This is an important victory, even if the bigger fight isn’t over,” Salaita added in a post on Facebook. “At this point I am ready to move beyond this particular matter and continue doing what I love – teaching, writing, organizing, and contributing in whatever way I can to struggles for justice.”\n\n“The University believes that reaching a settlement with Dr. Salaita is the most reasonable option to fully and finally conclude all of the pending issues,” Urbana-Champaign Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson said.\n\n“Although the amount is significant, it is less than what we would spend if the case were to continue and proceed to trial over the next year,” she added.\n\nThe university statement said Salaita would receive a lump sum of $600,000, while the remaining amount would cover his legal fees.\n\nCause celebre\n\nSalaita’s case became a cause celebre for academic freedom, highlighting the role of pro-Israel donors in pressuring university administrators.\n\nThousands of academics pledged to boycott the university until he was reinstated.\n\nThe Salaita affair devastated and demoralized the university’s celebrated American Indian Studies program, leading to the departure of several faculty.\n\nHis firing also earned the University of Illinois a formal censure from the American Association of University Professors for violating academic freedom, a rare rebuke and severe blow to its reputation.\n\n“The petitions, demonstrations, and investigations, as well as the legal case, have reinvigorated American higher education as a place of critical thinking and rigorous debate, and I am deeply grateful to all who have spoken out,” Salaita’s statement said.\n\nThe university has undoubtedly paid a high price by bowing to Israel lobby pressure. The settlement with Salaita deals only with the legal aspects of the matter but not with questions of ethics and academic freedom which will tar the university’s reputation for years to come and could discourage academics and students from applying there.\n\nStrong case\n\nSalaita had scored successes in the early phases of his federal lawsuit.\n\nIn August, US District Judge Harry Leinenweber backed Salaita’s contention that he had a binding contract with the university.\n\nYet there was never a guarantee that even if he won at trial that the court would order his reinstatement.\n\nIn September, the judge found that university officials had destroyed emails that may have contained key evidence Salaita needed to prove his case.\n\nThis came after sensational revelations that top officials, including then Chancellor Phyllis Wise, had been using private email accounts to discuss the case and evade disclosure laws.\n\nWise and another official, Provost Ilesanmi Adesida, resigned in disgrace, adding to the disarray at the frequently scandal-plagued state university.\n\n“Make no mistake: the size of this settlement is an implicit admission of the strength of Professor Salaita’s constitutional and contractual claims,” attorney Anand Swaminathan of Loevy & Loevy said.\n\n“In the future, university administrators will have to think twice before they choose the interests of wealthy donors and alumni over upholding their constitutional obligations,” Swaminathan added.\n\nIn August, Salaita took up a year-long post as Edward W. Said Chair of American Studies at the American University of Beirut.Steven Salaita speaks at the", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_173", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "The title of the article at the New York Post is fairly provacative to be sure. “Obama campaign accepted foreign web donation – and may be hiding more.” But this looks like one of those stories that may be less – and yet more – than it appears on the surface. First, to the details.\n\nThe Obama re-election campaign has accepted at least one foreign donation in violation of the law — and does nothing to check on the provenance of millions of dollars in other contributions, a watchdog group alleges. Chris Walker, a British citizen who lives outside London, told The Post he was able to make two $5 donations to President Obama’s campaign this month through its Web site while a similar attempt to give Mitt Romney cash was rejected. It is illegal to knowingly solicit or accept money from foreign citizens.\n\nWell, that certainly sounds pretty bad, doesn’t it? Obama taking donations from England? But if you read on there’s a bit more to this specific donation.\n\nWalker said he used his actual street address in England but entered Arkansas as his state with the Schenectady, NY, ZIP code of 12345. “When I did Romney’s, the payment got rejected on the grounds that the address on the card did not match the address that I entered,” he said. “Romney’s Web site wanted the code from the back of card. Barack Obama’s didn’t.”\n\nSo in this case, it turns out that Mr. Walker was intentionally entering distorted information with his donation, mixing an American looking address with an American (not matching) zip code, though the payment was coming from Europe. He was apparently doing it as a “test”of both campaigns – a test which Romney passed – but that’s hardly the same as accepting European donations with open arms. But what it does do is call to light an equally serious problem with the Obama campaign’s system of processing payments. It’s an important distinction which any professional campaign should have been able to sew up and avoid running afoul of the law. The Daily Caller explains.\n\nThe upcoming GAI report suggests the Obama campaign is allowing fraudulent donations to be accepted because the president isn’t employing proper safeguards against fraudulent donations. GAI leaves open the possibility that the Obama campaign “may have experienced data-collection problems,” but argued “given the Obama campaign’s technological sophistication, the fact that the campaign consistently reports higher amounts of erroneous data month-to-month casts doubt on that explanation.” “A robust anti-fraud address verification system (AVS) would require an accurate zip code to process a credit card transaction,” the report reads. “The presence of large sums of donations without such basic address information suggests that some campaigns are using looser security settings than others.” GAI said an AVS system “compares the numerical portion of the address a donor enters to the numerical information on file with the credit card company for the card.” “For example, most pay-at-the-pump gas stations require customers to enter their zip code,” GAI added. “Enter the wrong zip code or none at all, the transaction is denied.” GAI said that when a political campaign uses such an AVS system, it’s “invisible to outsiders.”\n\nSo it’s easy to lose sight of the story if you’re only looking to see if Team Obama is intentionally soliciting illegal donations from outside of the country. (And some of the President’s defenders are doing just that.) But given the fact that questions have already come up regarding the President’s team’s handling of such contributions, it’s completely valid to ask why this hasn’t been fixed by now. And perhaps more to the point, it’s not as if Obama has been hurting for small donors this year. Why wouldn’t you take the time to make sure you’re following the rules? An extra $200 bucks can not be worth the problems which will come from an illegal campaign contribution scandal.The title of the article at the New York Post is fairly provacative to be sure. “Obama campaign accepted foreign web donation – and may be hiding more.” But this looks like one of those stories that may be less – and yet more – than it appears on the surface.

I know it sounds harsh, I know it sounds difficult, but they're creating a crisis that's going to harm these children,\" he said on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nLabrador added that the frustration building up is because the administration is doing nothing about border security.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Jim Loney and Frances Kerry)U.S. needs 'to do right' for immigrant children: official\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. official said on Sunday the U.S. border is not open to illegal entry into the country, but acknowledged the government does need to be sensitive to the tens of thousands of migrant children flowing into detention centers.\n\nMore than 52,000 unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have been caught trying to sneak over the U.S.-Mexico border since October, double the number from the same period the year before.

The lawsuit also states that the letter of intent clearly outlined the use of the premise as a marijuana dispensary, after receiving approval by the city.\n\nIn September 2016, The Apothecarium became one of two marijuana dispensaries unanimously granted a permit by City Council after the city changed the legal limit of medical marijuana dispensaries from four to six. The Apothecarium and Berkeley Compassionate Care Center were selected out of five dispensary applicants.\n\nAs location of the dispensaries was one of the factors considered in selection, by refusing to allow possession of the premise for months after receiving permit, the dispensary may lose its permit according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition, the lawsuit states that BTHHM has spent more than $400,000 over the last two years, which includes $140,000 in rent toward Johnston, and additional fees to secure the location and obtain its permit.\n\nJohnston has insisted on making changes to terms which were agreed upon, which includes raising the base rent from $6,400 to $12,600 every month, raising the security deposit from $12,800 to $50,000 and making structural improvements to the property which is estimated to cost $700,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\n“Johnston’s actions since the Permit was issued make abundantly clear that Johnston has absolutely no intent of following through on his obligations under the Agreement to deliver passion of the Premises or execute a lease with BTHHM,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nCity Councilmember Kriss Worthington said, however, that there have been cases, such as with the Berkeley Permit Group, in which a dispensary relocates without losing its permit as long as they go through the standard procedure.\n\n“I hope the sides can work out a compromise,” Worthington said. “I would be happy to help facilitate so neither side gets hurt too much getting the city to approve permit getting (The Apothecarium) moved to another property.”\n\nIn the case BTHHM is not allowed to move to another property and loses its permit, BTHHM will have to secure another location and go through the permit process another time which could take years and another $400,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nChristine Lee is an assistant editor.

{"id": "sample_7_183", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " to the lasting public impression of the conflict. Names such as the ‘Accrington Pals’, ‘Glasgow Tramways’ and the two ‘Football Battalions’ have been documented in many forms – both fact and fiction – since the end of the conflict, and the frequently tragic stories of their involvement in the trenches on the Western Front are now relatively familiar.\n\nThere was, however, another citizen army raised during the First World War. Not based on location and not destined for the front line, these soldiers were enlisted with the specific intention of applying their technical skills to the industrial challenges thrown up by the Western Front. In few areas was this process more pronounced than in the sphere of transportation, critical to the maintenance and sustenance of the armies in the trenches. This post looks at just one of the directorates formed during the war to supervise, organize and manage the logistics network on the Western Front, the Directorate of Inland Water Transport [IWT].\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, the British Army had no organization to take advantage of the canal networks of France and Belgium. This changed in December 1914 when Commander Gerald Edward Holland was authorized by the War Office to investigate the potential use of IWT as a supplement to the road and railway networks. As the rank suggests, Holland’s background was not army, but navy, having joined the Royal Indian Marine in 1880. Having seen service in Burma and South Africa, Holland retired from service in 1905 and took up the post of Marine Superintendent of the London and North Western Railway at Holyhead. It was in this capacity that Holland was employed until 1914.\n\nHolland’s diary of the first few months of the IWT directorate’s existence remains, and demonstrates both the duties of a ‘chateau general’ on the supply chain, and the type of men Holland required to populate the new service. Unfortunately, as with so many unofficial diaries, the detailed, enthusiastic entries of the initial months eventually diminish into perfunctory statements before the diary abruptly ends in May 1915. So the diary does not give a full account of the development of a transportation service, however it does offer an insight into the course of action followed by Holland in the first weeks of 1915.\n\nArriving in France just after Christmas 1914, Holland’s first days were spent inspecting the canal network in France, talking to local barge owners and sketching out a potential policy for the use of canals to supply the expanding British force. Much of January was then given over to the familiar business practice of interviewing potential applicants for commissions in the new directorate, many of whom had little or no military experience.\n\nWhat they did have were desirable skills. Obvious examples include those with previous boating experience such as Horace Pitman, a ten-year veteran yachtsman, albeit with ‘bad sight in one eye’, a man with six years’ experience operating transports on the Gold Coast, and a boat builder with knowledge of the French and Belgian canal network (and, significantly, knowledge of the French language). Alongside these men were a large group, some fifty in all, hand-picked from Holyhead and the London and North-Western’s Marine Department.\n\nNot all were boating experts, however. Gerald Douglas, a civil engineer, was appointed as a Lieutenant; a trained Lloyd’s Surveyor who had enlisted in the infantry after the outbreak of the war was re-employed as an Inspector of new barges, a former civil servant from the Nigerian government arrived to use his organizational talents to the newly emerging directorate, and a Private R.H. Williams, curiously described as ‘intelligent looking’ by Holland, was transferred from the Public Schools Battalion thanks to his previous experience working for the London and North-Western.\n\nThese men were soldiers, each were sent to the Royal Engineers’ training camp at Longmoor prior to their posting in France, but they were not primarily occupied with the same challenges as those members of the ‘fighting services’; infantry, artillery and cavalry. Instead, their challenge was to introduce, adapt and develop their business talents to a problem familiar to any manufacturing business, that of moving goods from one place to another. Their motivation was not profit for their employers, but quite literally a matter of life and death for those who depended entirely upon an efficient, reliable supply of food, arms and myriad other goods.\n\nTheir sacrifice may not have been the ‘ultimate’ one which will be forever linked to the civilians of ‘Kitchener’s Armies’, but the contribution of the IWT – one among many of the ancillary services which were crucial to the ‘military machine’ – was of direct importance to the war effort, and the work of the ‘other’ citizen soldiers deserves to be the subject of further understanding and future commemoration.", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

The error, he said, was made when the unidentified staffer read an email from the mayor’s office. The staffer, however, did not read which bill was vetoed by the mayor, according to Chambers.\n\n“Ryan, we have policies and procedures in place that were not followed,” he said. “She assumed it was the marijuana legislation. That was not the case.”\n\nThe mayor actually vetoed the sale of a portion of land to Hapeville, according to the council.\n\nCORRECTION: Mayor's veto was regarding the sale of a portion of land to Hapeville, GA — Atlanta City Council (@ATLCouncil) October 11, 2017\n\n“President Mitchell did not have anything to do with this,” said Chambers, who did not specify how the new staffer would be discplined.\n\nReed didn’t buy the explanation and said he questioned if Chambers should remain in his post as the head of communications.\n\n“This was intentional,” he said. “This was a political stunt. Y’all were trying to score political points. Go tell your folks you fell on the sword.”\n\nReed, who makes regular appearances on Cameron’s show, said he planned to tout the signing of the legislation and a related ceremony on Wednesday’s program — before the social media firestorm.\n\nHe said he signed the measure, which will reduce the penalty for possessing an ounce or less of pot in the city from $1,000 to $75 and eliminate jail time under those circumstances, at 6:24 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nAfter the show, he tweeted a picture of that moment.A new staffer faces disciplinary action after a tweet from the Atlanta City Council’s verified account created a political firestorm early Wednesday.\n\nThe erroneous tweet, which indicated Mayor Kasim Reed vetoed a measure intended to reduce penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana, was pushed out to thousands of the council’s followers just after 6 a.m. — nearly 12 hours after he signed the legislation.\n\nGood morning #Atlanta.

{"id": "sample_7_202", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Gamers love a good challenge. Unless it involves an underwater level. Or a mine cart. Or pretty much anything from Mega Man 9. Come to think of it, gamers are frustrated by a lot of things. Here's a tribute to the levels that made us collectively break our controllers.\n\n1. Battle Toads: Turbo Tunnel\n\nThe most annoying level of the Citizen Kane of near-impossible video games, the BattleToads speederbike level, is the reason why the Game Genie and adderall were invented. Nothing short of John Nash-like spatial recognition is enough, as even thousands of plays can still leave the most talented gamers in the fetal position. What sets it apart from other classic video games, and what is perhaps its most annoying quality, is that years later it still retains the same level of difficulty it had when you were 9.\n\n2. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Dam Water Level\n\nNES\n\nTMNT\n\n3. StarFox 64: MacBeth/Titania\n\nApparently the developers of theversion of the classicarcade game weren't satisfied with simply desecrating probably the greatest multi- player arcade game ever conceived. They had to make the underwater levelalways a bane of any gamer's existencethe single most difficult underwater level in video game history. The obstacle list reads more like a grocery list for someone shopping a medical marijuana facility (Electric seaweed, Energy Draining Leaves, 8 Bombs) than a proper collection of video game obstructions.\n\nLook, we appreciate the StarFox developers being courteous enough to give the Landmaster as many Arwing-ian qualities as possiblesmart bombs, locking onto enemies with the laser, even doing a Barrel rollwe get it, thank you. But you don't go to a seafood restaurant and order a cheese burger, and if we wanted to roll around in a tank, we'd play Twisted Metal. Now get us back to the goddamn planes.\n\n4. Mike Tyson's Punchout!: Mike Tyson\n\nThe most annoying aspect of fighting the title character in Mike Tyson's Punchout! isn't the uppercut that signals instant death for anyone on the receiving end, or the grotesquely large physique of someone who could destroy you even if he was half your size, or even the fact that your character was given an embarrassingly limited repertoire of moves. No, the most annoying aspect is the fact that in 1987, Mike Tyson's Punchout! was possibly the most realistic game ever invented.\n\n5. MarioKart: Rainbow Road\n\nPage 1 of 3 Next\n\nThere isn't really anything super complicated to navigate on Rainbow Road, but it's the ultra minimalist and, let's face it, ingenious act of simply removing the railings that helps it make the list. Because the mark of a truly annoying video game comes from your complete and total confidence being crushed at a moment's notice by the simplest of mistakes.Gamers love a good challenge. Unless it involves an underwater level. Or a mine cart. Or pretty much anything from Mega Man 9. Come to think of it, gamers are frustrated by a lot of things. Here's a tribute to the levels that made us collectively break our controllers.\n\n1. Battle Toads: Turbo Tunnel\n\nThe most annoying level of the Citizen Kane of near-impossible video games, the BattleToads speederbike level, is the reason why the Game Genie and adderall were invented. Nothing short of John Nash-like spatial recognition is enough, as even thousands of plays can still leave the most talented gamers in the fetal position. What sets it apart from other classic video games, and what is perhaps its most annoying quality, is that years later it still retains the same level of difficulty it had when you were 9.\n\n2. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Dam Water Level\n\nNES\n\nTMNT\n\n3. StarFox 64: MacBeth/Titania\n\nApparently the developers of theversion of the classicarcade game weren't satisfied with simply desecrating probably the greatest multi- player arcade game ever conceived. They had to make the underwater levelalways a bane of any gamer's existencethe single most difficult underwater level in video game history. The obstacle list reads more like a grocery list for someone shopping a medical marijuana facility (Electric seaweed, Energy Draining Leaves, 8 Bombs) than a proper collection of video game obstructions.\n\nLook, we appreciate the StarFox developers being courteous enough to give the Landmaster as many Arwing-ian qualities as possiblesmart bombs, locking onto enemies with the laser, even doing a Barrel rollwe get it, thank you. But you don't go to a seafood restaurant and order a cheese burger, and if we wanted to roll around in a tank, we'd play Twisted Metal.

{"id": "sample_7_205", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "A “Tourtière” is a meat pie from Quebec, and is a classic part of the Christmas/Christmas Eve réveillon and New Year’s Eve meal (It’s also great when you are having a bunch of people over for dinner and you are sick of making “bangers in a cloud”, another great recipe that I will post soon). While meat pies are found in many cultures and parts of the world, the tourtiere gets its name from the the creature from which it was traditionally made, the “tourte,” or passenger pigeon. These days there is no one filling that makes a tourtiere what it is, it may be made from any type of meat, though the most common ones are made with pork, veal, beef, or a combination of meats (if you hunt dove, it might be an interesting way to prepare the bird, similar to the original recipe). In Quebec, serving this won’t turn heads, but in the US, tourtiere is not so common, and you may get some “what the… Meat pie?” type of comments. Ignore them, and remember… Knives are for threatening, too. This dish has a lot of flavor, and this is one of my favorite touriere recipes. When you try this, you will see why this is so popular up north.\n\nIngredients:\n\nPastry dough for a bottom and top crust (store-bought is fine)\n\n1 tablespoon light olive or canola oil\n\n1/2 pound ground pork\n\n1/2 pound ground beef\n\n3/4 cup chopped onion\n\n1 clove garlic, crushed and finely chopped\n\n1/3 cup shredded carrots\n\n1/4 cup finely chopped celery\n\n2/3 cup beef stock\n\n2 tablespoons Cognac\n\n1 teaspoon dried parsley\n\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n1/4 teaspoon dried sage\n\n1/4 teaspoon dried thyme\n\n1/16 teaspoon ground cloves\n\n1/16 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n1/16 teaspoon grated nutmeg\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n2. Roll out your pastry dough and cut into two equal circles, enough to fit a 9-inch pie pan, and line the bottom of the pan with one piece of the dough.\n\n3. In a pan, heat the oil and saute onion, garlic, celery, and carrot briefly. Add the meat and cook until done.\n\n4. Drain the excess oil and add the stock, herbs, spices, and cognac to the pan and simmer over a low to medium heat for about 15 minutes.\n\n5. Allow to sit for about 5 minutes and then spoon the mixture into the pastry crust in the pie pan and cover with the remaining dough.\n\n6. Seal the pie crust, cut a few vents in the top, and design however you please (if you please).\n\n7. Reduce the heat to 350 and bake the tourtiere for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top turns a golden brown.\n\n8. Let cool for a bit and serve while still warm.\n\nThis will easily serve 6 to 8 people and the proportions can be increased to be made in a larger pie mold (or pan).A “Tourtière” is a meat pie from Quebec, and is a classic part of the Christmas/Christmas Eve réveillon and New Year’s Eve meal (It’s also great when you are having a bunch of people over for dinner and you are sick of making “bangers in a cloud”, another great recipe that I will post soon).

{"id": "sample_7_221", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "The chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi lashed out at President Barack Obama’s willful failure to respond to document requests from the panel, whose work the chairman wanted completed by December.\n\n“This committee’s thorough, fact-centered investigation has been repeatedly stonewalled by the Obama administration, Ranking Member Elijah Cummings , and Committee Democrats ,” said Rep. Trey Gowdy (R.-S.C.), a former federal prosecutor and also a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nThe select committee was impaneled to investigate the events surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on American personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nGowdy said the White House has accumulated 10,000 days of delay—totaling more than 27 years.\n\nIn the last nine months, requests from the committee have received documents delayed nearly 6,000 days, with the shortest delay of 136 days and the longest delay taking 534 days, he said.\n\nOne of the most vocal members of the committee, Rep. James Jordan (R.-Ohio), said he backed up his chairman and shared his frustration.\n\n“Instead of addressing its failures to protect Americans abroad, has consistently stonewalled congressional efforts to uncover the truth,” Jordan said. He continued:\n\nWhen former Secretary Clinton came before the Benghazi committee, she obfuscated instead of addressing the fact that she hid the truth from the American people and more importantly the families of those who died, while acknowledging to her family and to the prime minister of Libya and the president of Egypt that it was indeed a terrorist attack and had nothing to do with a video. This is what frustrates folks around the country. They understand that sometimes good men and women give their lives serving our country. But what they can’t accept is when their leaders aren’t straight with them and won’t own up to their mistakes.\n\nCritical to the panel’s work is that members and staff must review documents before calling and questioning witnesses, so to further compound and confound the committee’s inquest, the administration then delays the appearance of witnesses.\n\nGowdy said Congress specifically reprogrammed $6.5 million in the State Department budget to elevate the administration’s practice of stalling documents and witnesses.\n\n“Not only have they failed to identify a single administration witness worth talking to or a single document worth accessing in the past two years, they have affirmatively delayed the identification of witnesses and the production of unquestionably relevant documents,” he said.\n\nThe chairman said he was particularly upset by how Democrats on the committee have worked to thwart his efforts. “Committee Democrats have not lifted a finger to help the Select Committee speed up its investigation and release a report.”\n\nJordan said although Obama and the Democrats have hindered the investigation, the investigation continues to press forward.\n\n“We would have wrapped up our investigation by now if we weren’t still waiting for documents from the State Department,” he said. “This administration has continually dragged its feet instead of helping us do our job and get to the truth about what happened when four Americans lost their lives in Benghazi. Despite this administration’s efforts, we are making headway and nearing the completion of our report.”\n\nNo other scandal intertwines the legacies of Obama with his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton as tightly or as exquisitely. Each one knows what the other did and did not do that long night in Benghazi. Each one needs to hold the uneasy truce in place until Election Day .\n\nMaybe then, Gowdy and the rest of us will finally find out what really happened.The chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi lashed out at President Barack Obama’s willful failure to respond to document requests from the panel, whose work the chairman wanted completed by December.\n\n“This committee’s thorough, fact-centered investigation has been repeatedly stonewalled by the Obama administration, Ranking Member Elijah Cummings , and Committee Democrats ,” said Rep.

First he signed on to create, direct, and serve as showrunner on Marvel’s first Netflix series Daredevil. But after penning the first two scripts and working to conceive the series, Goddard got an opportunity he couldn’t pass up: writing and directing a Sinister Six movie as part of Sony’s Spider-Man universe. So he left his showrunner role on Daredevil to develop and write Sinister Six, but unfortunately after The Amazing Spider-Man 2’s release, Sony opted to scrap its interconnected universe plans and team up on a new reboot with Marvel Studios as a partner, effectively cancelling Goddard’s Sinister Six.\n\nIt hasn’t been all bad for Goddard—he was nominated for an Oscar for penning 2015’s blockbuster The Martian, he still serves as an executive producer on Daredevil, and he helmed the pilot of one of this year’s best new shows The Good Place—but it was a bummer to see his directorial projects fall apart. Luckily, Goddard is now lining up a new project to direct, and it’s a 100% original.\n\nPer THR, Goddard just sold a secretive spec script titled Bad Times at the El Royale to 20th Century Fox which he will produce and direct. Details are being kept firmly under wraps, but it’s described as a contained thriller with either sci-fi or horror elements—which doesn’t sound dissimilar from Cabin in the Woods.\n\nIndeed, Goddard kept this thing so close to the vest that when he was shopping the script to studios, it was only sent to top studio execs and they had to read it on an iPad that they’d then have to hand back to a courier, bypassing the normal reading process.\n\nThis is great news, not only that Goddard is getting back behind the camera, but that it’s an original project. We recently broke the news that Goddard is also working on the script for Deadpool 2, so the guy is certainly in demand. But Cabin in the Woods showed a confidence of vision as a filmmaker, and I can’t wait to see what surprises Bad Times at the El Royale has in store.0\n\nComing off the success of his directorial debut The Cabin in the Woods, which he also co-wrote with Joss Whedon, filmmaker Drew Goddard lined up a couple of exciting and massive filmmaking opportunities that unfortunately fell through.

Eric Brazau handed out a flyer that “vilified Muslims and disparages their religion,” Ontario court Judge S. Ford Clements said in February, when he found Brazau guilty.\n\nEric Brazau was convicted of willful promotion of hatred against Muslims and criminally harassing a Muslim family. ( CARLOS OSORIO / TORONTO STAR FILE PHOTO )\n\nThe case was far from being on the borderline between “rough and tumble debate” and hate speech, as Brazau had argued, Clements said in a College Park courtroom. Brazau handed out the flyer, which contained many offensive references to Islam and Muslims, in August and September 2012. While distributing it, Brazau sometimes yelled obscenities about Islam “in a tone of voice that suggested he was very angry and had little interest in debate,” Clements said. Brazau had argued that he did not intend to promote hate speech; instead he wanted to stimulate debate about censorship, “blasphemy laws” and Sharia law, Clements said.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nClements disagreed. “He knew the material would deeply wound and anger Muslims,” said Clements. The content was not humorous, ironic or satirical, he said. “Mr. Brazau is far too intelligent to believe this to be so.” The flyer also contained a somewhat blurred photograph of a Muslim family on a downtown Toronto street.\n\nThe man in the photo testified that Brazau called him a “terrorist” on the day Brazau took the photo. In a second interaction a few weeks later on a sidewalk, the man, whose name is protected by a publication ban, said that Brazau approached him aggressively while photographing the family, making him “concerned and fearful.”\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nClements found this to be criminal harassment. During sentencing submissions, Crown prosecutor Derek Ishak described Brazau as an “unrepentant hatemonger … who abused his right to freedom of speech in a planned, deliberate manner,” Clements said Tuesday in his sentencing decision. However, Clements said that while Brazau’s conduct was “despicable” and his beliefs “repugnant,” the maximum sentence of six months for a summary conviction on willfully promoting hatred was unwarranted. He also noted the defence submission that Brazau committed his offences in public, where he was easily identifiable, rather than by stealth. Instead, he gave Brazau a four-month sentence, plus two months for criminal harassment and mischief and three months for breach of probation by not keeping the peace. Brazau, who had spent nine months in pre-trial custody, was sentenced to time served. Clements declined to ban Brazau from distributing flyers, since that could impede his right to freedom of expression. Outside the court, Brazau said he will appeal his sentence. He says he is aware the flyer was “problematic” and “would offend.” But his voice won’t be silenced, Brazau added, though he will keep in mind the hate speech laws, which he says he has learned to navigate over the past few months. “Hatred is the harvest he wanted to gather,” Clements said in his conviction decision, quoting William Butler Yeats. “I find this is true of Mr. Brazau.” Last month, a small claims court found that Brazau had been wrongfully arrested and detained while protesting near Sgt. Ryan Russell’s funeral procession in 2011. However, the deputy judge also found his conduct “reprehensible” and awarded him only $1,000 in damages.A notorious protester convicted of wilfully promoting hatred against Muslims and criminally harassing a Muslim man and his family was sentenced Tuesday to nine months in jail.

And we had no idea that an even better test for a presidential candidate than his or her ability to handle that 3 AM phone call was the ability to not send that 12 AM email.\n\nSeptember 11, 2012 was the first day in about a year in which Mitt Romney didn’t lob incendiary, specious attacks at the president. He decided to honor the eleventh anniversary of the tragic events of 9/11 with a little decorum. As he did, the president’s post convention bounce continued and the conservative media began to turn on Mitt. Within a few hours Rush and Laura Ingraham and Bill Kristol all savaged his performance, saying basically anyone could beat Obama so Romney must be terrible.\n\nMitt’s problem? He wasn’t attacking enough.\n\nFor Republicans — who are still willing to employee all of the people who planned the failed Iraq War and still want to offer more tax breaks for the rich after the Bush tax breaks created no jobs — the problem can’t ever be their ideas. And since they decided before any of his policies took effect that President Obama was a failure, they just couldn’t be losing to him. No, it must be that Mitt — who has been throwing invented charges at the president for a full year – just isn’t being nasty enough.\n\nSo what did Mitt do around 12 AM of September 12?\n\nHe decided that he would take a tragedy that was still unfolding and use it to make a political point in a scathing email statement. Conservatives were complaining about a statement that the American embassy in Cairo put out trying to soothe the protesters. So when a likely unrelated attack on our embassy in Benghazi took the life of an American Ambassador, he took that critique and used to attack the president via email.\n\nAnything to get the knives out of his back and into the president.\n\nMitt’s email and his smirking defense of it in a press conference have been roundly criticized by almost everyone—except, of course, some of the same maniacs who planned and supported the Iraq War.\n\nMitt’s defenders called the moment Reaganesque—except they never bothered to look at how Reagan handled such situations in his 1980 campaign.\n\nYou could say that the performance was George W. Bushlike, but our memories of the results of the Administration have blurred our understanding of Bush. W. made terrible decisions and hired terrible advisers. But he never did so in a rushed, obviously harried way. He had the confidence of knowing he had support from his dad’s old allies and the steady backing of the right wing press, which at the time was less potent.\n\nIn an era where Fox News, AM radio, Drudge and Breitbart are increasingly fact free and set on destruction, a weak candidate like Mitt Romney who has to bend to their ridiculous whims is especially dangerous.\n\nMitt Romney didn’t understand, or didn’t care, that he was commenting on and inflaming a crisis that is still in progress, putting American diplomats all over the Middle East at risk. His goal is stopping the president’s bounce and he doesn’t even understand the last thing he needs to worry about right wing that never will never really love him.\n\n(Keep in mind that if Mitt defies the odds and is elected, his reliance on the right wing media to avoid a primary challenge will be even more desperate.)\n\nRomney had a chance to show the center what kind of president he would be. And that 12 AM email revealed that he’s a man who has no idea what message he should send.\n\n[Photo by Anne Savage.]Still looking for that “exploiting a tragedy” bounce\n\nIn 2008, candidate Hillary Clinton questioned candidate Barack Obama’s ability to handle that 3 AM phone call that would inevitably come.\n\nWhat we didn’t know then is that Barack Obama would be the man who — with Hillary Clinton’s assistance — would make the call to take out Osama bin Laden.

{"id": "sample_7_250", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " far from alone. Few buzzwords raise as much excitement among leaders in the emerging world, who hope to turn their traffic-clogged megacities into pristine recreations of Singapore or Barcelona.\n\nUnfortunately, egged on by swarms of technology companies and management consultants, these visions of technological utopia face a real risk of turning into expensive delusions.\n\nLURE OF CITY LIFE\n\nIndia announced the names of a dozen more smart cities last month, bringing to 33 the number of urban areas that will now spend a reported US$12 billion (S$16.3 billion) installing everything from traffic-management technologies to smart electricity grids.\n\nMore such cities are expected to be identified later this year.\n\nOther countries are equally keen.\n\nNations like India, whose cities are beset by slums, yearn for a prosperous urban future. But getting there will require major governance and policy changes. This is because their cities, such as India's New Delhi (above), are places where traffic crawls, electricity supplies are patchy and drinkable water a pipe dream. PHOTO: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nChinese municipalities from Nanjing to Yinchuan have re-christened themselves as smart, and are spending heavily on Internet and energy networks.\n\nExcitement about smart cities tends to rest on the misapprehension that digitising something makes it smart. Technology can play a role in making cities more liveable, but it is a means to that end, not an end in itself.\n\nLast month, Sri Lanka signed a deal with Siemens, the German technology group, to help turn the capital Colombo into a smart \"megapolis\".\n\nThe idea of smart cities looks especially attractive to politicians in poorer Asian and African nations, as they try to tame urban areas dogged by weak governance, corruption and poor public services.\n\nAnd in countries like India, the current smart cities PR blitz has proven helpful as a means of both focusing political energy on urbanisation, and ending a damaging rural bias dating back to national founder Mohandas Gandhi.\n\nLeaders across emerging Asia now know they will have to cope with massive future migration to cities.\n\nIn India, an estimated 250 million will move away from rural villages over the two decades to 2030.\n\nThe share of gross domestic product generated by cities in countries like India is expected to rise to more than 70 per cent by 2020, according to Barclays.\n\nThese cities - where people and firms collocate, encouraging the spread of ideas - will be the wealth creation engines of the Asian century.\n\nPoverty in China, for instance, is now almost entirely a rural phenomenon.\n\nLess than 2 per cent of city dwellers live below the minimum income line, adjusted for purchasing power parity, according to the China Household Income Project.\n\nNations like India, whose cities are beset by slums, yearn for a similarly prosperous urban future. But getting there will require major governance and policy changes, as any visitor to Bangalore or New Delhi will quickly realise.\n\nThese are places where traffic crawls, electricity supplies are patchy and drinkable water a pipe dream, and that is before all these new people arrive. Such areas badly need well-planned urban expansions.\n\nYet, it is far from clear that smart cities - with their visions of super-fast broadband access and streets criss-crossed by neat cycle paths - are the best way to answer this challenge.\n\nMISPLACED PRIORITIES\n\nThe problem begins with the term itself, which has become an unhelpful catch-all.\n\nIt is perfectly sensible for advanced cities like Singapore to spend heavily on sensors monitoring everything from flood levels to parking spaces.\n\nIn cities like Chennai or Jakarta, with more basic requirements for sanitation or transport, such expenditure often make less sense.\n\nThis is partly because plans for smart cities in poorer countries tend to over-focus on glass and chrome buildings and gee-whiz technology, while saying little about the people who already live there.\n\nThey also rarely seem to understand how places like Singapore became wealthy in the first place, long before the advent of digital technologies, largely by focusing on basic services and infrastructure.\n\nAt a deeper level, excitement about smart cities tends to rest on the misapprehension that digitising something makes it smart. Technology can play a role in making cities more liveable, but it is a means to that end, not an end in itself.\n\nIt is as if Medellin went from being one of the crime capitals of the world to Colombia's fastest growing city by installing sensors, rather than grappling with the difficult business of law and order or providing better urban transport.\n\nSTAYING REALISTIC\n\nThe upshot is that countries like India have to be more realistic about what smart cities can deliver.\n\nMeanwhile, technology companies like Cisco and IBM, alongside exemplar nations like", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_261", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " heritage is famous the world over, its a great tag for Varanasi,” the city’s mayor, Ramgopal Mohle said in an interview.\n\nMohle said the UNESCO tag had already provided a fillip to tourism, helping artists and musicians from Varanasi to visit countries that are a part of this network. Nine cities — Glasgow in the UK, Hanover and Mannheim in Germany, Ghent in Belgium, Hamamatsu in Japan, Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo, Bogota in Columbia, Seville in Spain and Bologna in Italy — are a part of the UNESCO chain. “Varanasi is immersed in both religion and history. It is already the world’s spiritual capital, we will be reinforcing the claim,” says Mohle.\n\nFor decades, the city — claims Awasthi — has remained high on the calendar of international travellers to India, also a large number of domestic travellers.\n\nIn 530 BC, the Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment near Varanasi, but by then the city was already 500 years old. As per Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by God Shiva, lord of destruction and creation, and is the physical and spiritual centre of the Hindu universe. The city is home to a little over 1.2 million people and an estimated 1,500 temples and shrines, attracting pilgrims from India, and the world.\n\nHindus who visit Varanasi have strong beliefs, so do Buddhists who visit Sarnath on the outskirts of the city. Hindu devotees believe that anyone who dies within the city limits attains instant moksha, or redemption, freeing the soul from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Many spend thousands of rupees transporting bodies to be cremated at two sacred ghats — Manikarnika and Raja Harish Chandra — in the city, also home to many sick and elderly living in hospices, waiting to die.\n\nAwasthi did not further spell out details of the project but it is reliably learnt that a host of Hollywood and Bollywood stars, performing artists, international and Indian scholars would be roped in for the project. Interestingly, the idea to turn the city into a spiritual centre was triggered after a visit to Varanasi last year by ageing Hollywood star Morgan Freeman for a six-part National Geographic series, The Story of God.\n\nMorgan, who had travelled to seven countries for the series, had then told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that his experience was fascinating in Varanasi, one of the most prominent religious and spiritual centres in the world for centuries. “I found Varanasi extremely fascinating. The ambience in Varanasi is extraordinary. It is the holiest of holy cities in India on the holiest river in India. Learning that reincarnation, you can bypass it in Varanasi, did you know that? That was news to me,” said the Bruce Almighty star who loved the cacophonous traffic on the streets.\n\n“There were no lights, there were no guides. It just keeps going. How in the world do they do that? You don’t see people lying alongside the road having been run over, you don’t see dead dogs or chickens lying in the road having been run over, everything manages to function on the roads,” Morgan told the agency.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the state government had approached Morgan.\n\nVaranasi chronicler Gaurav Kapoor says the idea is taking shape slow, but steadily. “This is not a new phenomenon, the state government has been at it for long, probably now its taking shape.”\n\nIt is reliably learnt that the state government would also seek the help of the US-based Dr David Frawley, an acclaimed author on Indian spirituality and yoga practitioner who has deep knowledge of Varanasi and its history. A mail to Dr Frawley, a regular visitor to India, remained unanswered.\n\nKapoor said the move to push Varanasi as the world’s spiritual capital will have great backers, especially from the West. The list of top notch visitors from the West, claims Kapoor, is both huge and impressive.\n\nCelebrated sitar artist Pandit Ravi Shankar’s ashes were immersed in the holy waters of Varanasi by his daughters, Anoushka and Norah Jones in March 2013. Celebrated models and actors Seal and Heidi Klum, till they were married, routinely sought priests from Varanasi every year to take vows as per Hindu rites because they were mesmerised by the city and its culture.\n\nSinger Madonna took lessons in Sanskrit over the phone from Vagish Shastri of Kundalini Yoga Peeth way back in 1998, for her album Ray of Light, Grammy award winner Sting spent some time in Varanas", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_265", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "In the nineteenth century, the march of progress made it possible for the first time for human science to contemplate and comprehend those phenomena which had long seemed to contravene the laws of nature. Within a matter of decades, concepts that had long been viewed as witchcraft or sorcery were laid bare in the terms of a new and secret science, and governments and organizations around the world began to classify, study, and collect all such anomalies. And, just as artists throughout history have turned a critical eye to the events of the day in their work, so too did the artists of this scientific Renaissance begin to interpret these new discoveries on canvas.\n\nBy the 1870s, Paris was the center of the world of anomalous art, and the city stood witness to endless debates about the role of the anomalous in art, or whether such a role existed at all. When in 1874 the famed Salon des Magnifiques refused to allow any \"works of a phantasmagorical nature\" to be displayed at their grand exhibition, those artists shut out by the committee organized their own counter-exhibition, to be held at the same time across the river. \"Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\", as the show came to be called, was the talk of the Parisian press for months, earning equal amounts of curiosity, dismissal, and outright derision, but the exiled gadflies had made their point - the paranormal, the anomalous, and the bizarre had found a place in the world of art and would not be so easily gotten rid of.\n\n\"Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\" held its exhibitions every ten years thereafter, and as time passed the world of anomalous art grew larger. From its beginnings in Paris, artists from all across France and Europe, and later from the Americas and the Orient as well, began attending the increasingly prestigious - and increasingly bizarre and difficult to keep hidden from the disdainful eyes of a concerned government - exhibition, expressing new and different interpretations of the role of the anomalous in human life. It was at the sixth decennial exhibition in 1924 that the growing rift between the two largest schools of thought - logical vs. emotional, science vs. faith, Old World vs. New - came to a head, for it was at that show that for the first time, the works of the French surrealist Marcel Duchamp would be exhibited alongside those of Ruiz Marcos, the Mexican artist whose themes of magical realism and religious awe intertwined with the viscerally accessible Forteana of our world had set art critics worldwide at war with each other.\n\nThose who saw the two during the days leading up to the opening of the exhibition said they spent nearly the entire time in heated discussion with one another (in English, for neither spoke the other's mother tongue confidently) about everything under the Sun - the importance of the artist in relation to his work, the importance of context, faith, knowledge, law, free will, God, the State, democracy, Marxism, the war, the League of Nations, and the best way to serve a cup of coffee. It seemed that they might continue bickering throughout the entire exhibition, but as the artists prepared to greet the assembled press on the morning of its grand opening, they appeared to have finally come to an understanding.\n\nIf there is one image that comes to the mind of any art historian when the 1924 Expo is brought up, it is of that iconic photo of Duchamp and Ruiz posing side by side with their fellow artists in front of the still-closed doors, Marcos seemingly leaning over to whisper something into Duchamp's ear. For decades, many have speculated on what words Marcos had for his colleague during that memorable instant; a question of metaphysics? Or a challenge? An affirmation of their coming to terms? A reminder of the reason why they were there at that moment of time? Perhaps an expression of amazement at the multitudes that had come to see them? According to one reporter who claimed he stood close enough to overhear that whisper amidst the din of the crowd, it was all five at once, expressed in four simple words;\n\n\"Are we cool yet?\"\n\n- Excerpt from The Coolest War: Memories of a Critic, by AnonymousIn the nineteenth century, the march of progress made it possible for the first time for human science to contemplate and comprehend those phenomena which had long seemed to contravene the laws of nature.

I know I’m in the wrong. My mother would not approve,” the 30-year-old said sheepishly as she made a beeline from Mass at the Bethesda church to the gym. “But would it be better that I not come?”\n\nSummer in our sweltering region forces a theological question: How does God feel about exposed shoulders in a house of worship? Or toes? Or some glimpse of thigh?\n\nWith temperatures in the 80s by 7:30 a.m. services, this is the season for church bulletin items like the one in Our Lady’s: “Dignity & Decorum: Please try not to wear beach shorts, tank tops, and flip-flops to the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Thank you.”\n\nIn general, casual has pummeled formal everywhere in America, from airplanes to offices. But places of worship — where debates on modesty are not confined to the summer months — may be the final frontier for questions about what constitutes overly risque. And those questions have recently sprung to new life.\n\nA popular campaign aimed at young evangelical women called “Modest is Hottest” has triggered backlash by devout younger women who see the slogan as sexist. When the Bible calls for “modesty,” they argue, it refers to displays of things like wealth and is describing the depth of one’s spirit, not their neckline.Teaching women that their value rises if they have more clothes on is objectifying, a torrent of essays have argued.\n\n“A woman’s breasts and buttocks and thighs all proclaim the glory of the Lord,” said Sharon Hodde Miller, a doctoral student at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School whose critique of “modest is hottest” in the online evangelical magazine Christianity Today was one of the best-read of recent years. “Modesty is an orientation of the heart, first and foremost. It begins with putting God first. To look at an outfit and say if it’s modest or immodest, I’m not sure you can do that.”\n\nSome critics say the drive for looser, longer fabric has political tones, a “modesty nostalgia” for a happier, more fully clothed America that some feel never was. But advocates for less skin in the sanctuary see modest attire as transformational — part of the process of moving into a spiritual head space.\n\nParticularly today as institutional religion bleeds members, many churches — even some theologically conservative ones — advertise that dress is “come as you are.”\n\n“We don’t want clothes to ever be a barrier. That’s one reason we don’t talk about it,” said the Rev. Don Davidson of First Baptist Church of Alexandria.\n\nSome even argue that informal clothing signals not a new lack of respect for institutional religion but a new genuineness and familiarity.\n\nGrass-roots pew patrolling, on the other hand, is as alive as ever.\n\nCharisma Wooten, a singer and actor, had been a parishioner and lay leader at Refreshing Spring Church of God in Christ in Riverdale for more than 30 years when she was told moments before taking the pulpit for a Scripture reading one baking July Sunday a couple of years ago that she couldn’t because she didn’t have on pantyhose. Wooten said she was wearing a dress that nearly hit the floor, but Church of God in Christ is a formal denomination where ushers wear gloves and the handbook says that “dressing in a sensually provocative manner produces inclinations to evil desires.”\n\nAnother summer Sunday, Wooten was wearing a sleeveless black-and-white polka-dot dress and “my little matching shoes and hat,” when the pastor’s wife said sweetly: “Honey, aren’t you cold?” It took Wooten three days to realize she was likely being politely asked to cover her shoulders.\n\nWooten says she generally brushes it off when she’s been scolded for her church clothes, but the pantyhose incident led her to send a mass e-mail decrying the misplaced focus on rules and dogma.\n\n“You can follow all these rules men set up and be on your way to hell,” she said.\n\nConcepts of appropriate dress are, of course, a mix of denominational, regional", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_280", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "PHILADELPHIA -- Typically Eagles wide receivers and tight ends spend extra time after practice catching balls out of the JUGS machine, but rookie Jordan Matthews didn't do that on Tuesday.\n\nNo, after Tuesday's practice Matthews broke routine and spent several minutes attacking a blocking sled nearby trying to \"perfect every aspect of the game,\" as he put it on his way to the locker room.\n\nThe Vanderbilt product and second round draft choice probably had good reason to spend extra time refining his blocking skills because Eagles head coach Chip Kelly said Wednesday that the team doesn't have plans to move Matthews from the slot to the outside anytime soon.\n\n\"Could you [move him outside]? Yeah. Are we? No,\" Kelly said prior to Wednesday's practice. \"He's playing slot receiver for us right now. To move him outside, that doesn't help us in terms of where we are.

The Eagles only have six passing touchdowns so far this season and the rookie receiver accounts for one third of them.\n\nAt 6-foot-3, 212 pounds Matthews certainly fits the bill for the bigger receiver that Kelly covets in his offense, specifically in the slot where the receiver is responsible not only for underneath routes but also plays a key role in run blocking as well. Matthews has the build, but perhaps more importantly he seems to have the drive to succeed in that role as well.\n\n\"If that's my role that the coaches have me do, then I'm going to be the best slot receiver in the NFL each day in practice and in the games,\" Matthews said. \"That's going to be my goal. \"If that's my responsibility and that's my role, then that's what I'm going to focus in on and that's what I'm going to do.\"\n\nAfter a sluggish start in the preseason and accounting for just three catches in the first two games, Matthews has come on like gangbusters in the past two weeks accounting for 12 receptions for 87 yards and two touchdowns over that span.\n\n\"I think it just comes down to me being more comfortable out there in the offense,\" Matthews said. \"Nick [Foles] is already an elite quarterback. You can put anybody out there and Nick can make him look good.\n\n\"I'm just getting more comfortable so the more comfortable I get, the better that's going to be for both of us. Of course, you can't overlook practice because we go out there and practice with a purpose. We don't just go through the motions, we go full speed, Nick's finding me in certain spots on the field that he thinks he can hit me in the games and it's showing up on film each Sunday.\n\n\"We just have to keep building, getting better at it and I think it's going to help us a lot.\"\n\nJordan Matthews 9 Gallery: Jordan Matthews\n\nFollow Matt Lombardo on Twitter @MattLombardo975 . Find NJ.com Philadelphia Sports on FacebookPHILADELPHIA -- Typically Eagles wide receivers and tight ends spend extra time after practice catching balls out of the JUGS machine, but rookie Jordan Matthews didn't do that on Tuesday.\n\nNo, after Tuesday's practice Matthews broke routine and spent several minutes attacking a blocking sled nearby trying to \"perfect every aspect of the game,\" as he put it on his way to the locker room.\n\nThe Vanderbilt product and second round draft choice probably had good reason to spend extra time refining his blocking skills because Eagles head coach Chip Kelly said Wednesday that the team doesn't have plans to move Matthews from the slot to the outside anytime soon.\n\n\"Could you [move him outside]? Yeah. Are we? No,\" Kelly said prior to Wednesday's practice. \"He's playing slot receiver for us right now. To move him outside, that doesn't help us in terms of where we are. We need to have a big, physical slot in there, that's really what we're looking to do right now and he's still got a long ways to go as a slot receiver.\"\n\nMatthews, the Eagles second-round draft choice had a breakout performance in Week 3 hauling in his first two career touchdowns in an eight catch for 59 yard game against the Washington Redskins.\n\nThrough the first quarter of the season Matthews is third on the team in receiving with 15 catches for 141 yards and two scores.

{"id": "sample_7_281", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "After my exam earlier was postponed due to some problems between Pearson VUE and VMware Lab communications, I did my VCAP-DTM deploy last Friday. And it was a pass on the first attempt 🙂 Woohoo.\n\nThe exam is a whopping 3,4 (or somewhat with 205 minutes) hours getting through tasks where time management is the most important piece. Well next to actually knowing what you need to be doing. I missed some questions in the end, but 30 questions seem to be enough to barely pass. I was a bit slow as deployment is something I do differently in real life, irritated about the backspace not working (arrow del key combination is not my cookie) while my Pavlov keeps hitting that key and in the last part of the exam I had to keep pushing radio buttons several times before they got active.\n\nSome tips for the time management when you will attempt the exam:\n\nPrepare your exam lab experience. Do VMware Hands on Labs from the EUC mobily courses. Is it not for the subjects, is it knowing how to operate the lab environment. The exam lab is the same as the hands-on labs. I used several HOL-1751-MBL-1 and so on. Do note the Horizon are not the versions used in the VCAP6 version, but most items are still in the right place. I have also used Ravello Cloud for my labs. Bonus with the HOL’s is that you already have the password to use in the exam drilled.\n\nFamiliarize with the subjects. Read through the exam objectives and practice those in your own lab or hands on labs. These blog posts were very helpful: Going through the VCAP6-DTM Deploy Study guide several times with this blog post series: https://szumigalski.com/2016/08/01/vcap6-dtm-study-guide/. Prepare yourself about the exam lab environment with this blog post: http://sostechblog.com/2016/07/26/vcap6-dtm-desktop-and-mobility-deployment-exam-launch/.\n\nSchedule your exam. Have something to work to. Do this before starting to study, but allow for a reasonable study preparation period.\n\nThere is no non-native English speaker time extension, 205 minutes is what everyone gets.\n\nA VCAP study group with peers is worth it, especially working together on a shared goal and for sharing experiences, tips and tricks. At our company ITQ (http://itq.nl) we did VCAP Bootcamps were we had multiple sessions and let some of the team present an objective. Don’t have peers at your company that go for the same kind of exams? Well reach out on twitter, the community is strong in its knowledge sharing force and you will get a group in no time.\n\nMirage base layer and application layer capturing, restoring, as well as App Volumes capturing take time to complete. Make a note on your whiteboard and do some other questions while these are capturing. Return to see the progress.\n\nSet your environment to a comfortable screen resolution, mine was to set the screen to 1024×768. Also change this resolution in the Remote Desktop Manager. If you happen to need console access to a virtual machine (mostly RDP will work), use the web client not VMRC or the vSphere client console as the CTRL-ALT are not working.\n\nOnce at the exam, go through the exam questions, start the capturings, complete the ones you know, skip the ones you don’t know or are not sure about. You can navigate back and forth through the tasks, but don’t go skipping in berserk mode. Have some idea what questions are for what subjects, use your white board to write done the questions, make notes and mark completed, in progress or fail.\n\nDo take time to read the assignment, you have multiple clusters, desktops and connections servers. Don’t wasted time starting the task on the wrong component.\n\nDon’t let slow performance get you. This is a lab environment and not running in your exam centre or even region. It can be slow, be prepared and be patience. But that doesn’t mean that if it is unworkable you shouldn’t say something about it….\n\nKnow how Horizon architecture, application capturing and desktop pools work, know your way with Identity Manager (vIDM) and Mirage, know the lmvutil and vdmadmin command line help options, and you will be a okay. And yes that time management….\n\n– Enjoy your exam experience!\n\nSources: vmware.com, szumigalski.com, sostechblog.comAfter my exam earlier was postponed due to some problems between Pearson VUE and VMware Lab communications, I did my VCAP-", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_291", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " husband Nemorio phoned to tell her they had arrived safely.\n\nWhen she called the following day, the line was dead. The men never came back.\n\n'Authorities have never helped us'\n\nThe village they left behind lies by the side of a long dirt track which eventually widens out to a solitary, white-sanded beach.\n\nSmall, rudimentary houses are scattered between thick vegetation; the only sound that interrupts the silence is the crashing of the waves.\n\nHere money is scarce. The village had invested heavily in the tourism project. But when their husbands went missing, the wives took what little they had left and set off searching for their men.\n\n\"The truth is that in these two years we've been alone. The authorities have never helped us, neither economically or in the search for our husbands\" - Celerina Santos, wife of missing man\n\nThey talked to officials in government offices, searched prisons and visited morgues across the country.\n\nThey've sold off belongings to finance the search, including six of the boats they bought for the ecotourism project, and have bounced from state to state, following dead-end clues and red herrings handed to them by the same state investigators meant to help them.\n\nAfter two years of constant journeys, and little to show for it, Celerina feels abandoned by the authorities.\n\n\"The truth is that in these two years we've been alone. The authorities have never helped us, neither economically or in the search for our husbands,\" she said.\n\n'Bodies mounting up'\n\nTwenty-four thousand people have been reported missing, according to Mexico’s Human Rights Commission, many trapped in the battle between organised crime groups and the government.\n\nRelatives echo Celerina’s story, saying that when they turn to the authorities, they find them unwilling or unable to help.\n\nAl Jazeera tried to get basic details on the case of the missing men from Zapotengo, but our repeated calls and emails to the Tamaulipas and Oaxaca state attorneys offices, as well as the federal attorneys office, went unanswered.\n\nWhilst outgoing president Felipe Calderon’s administration has tried to tackle the problem of organised crime by pouring money into the Federal Police and its armed forces, the task of helping the victims of the violence has not figured high on the list of priorities.\n\nMexico's top human rights official says that almost 16,000 bodies are still to be identified, but after six years of bodies mounting up, the federal government has only just opened its first dedicated forensic centre, which can hold a maximum of 150 bodies.\n\nAlthough it has now been operational for nearly a month, it has yet to receive a single corpse; it has no powers to order Mexico's 32 states to send it their unidentified bodies, and none of them have yet offered.\n\n'Human rights have been ignored'\n\nLack of co-operation between state and federal authorities has frequently been blamed for the failure to find those lost among the violence in the country.\n\nTo try to close the gap, Calderon last year pledged to create a national database for missing persons that investigators from all states could use to track the disappeared - but so far it has failed to materialize.\n\nFederal officials told Al Jazeera they still don't know when it will be finished.\n\nAmnesty International spokesman Daniel Zapico says Mexico's inability to address the issue shows a general lack of political will.\n\n\"For us it is very clear. We need to put human rights in the agenda as one of the main issues in this situation,\" he said.\n\n\"Human rights have been ignored by this government and also at the local and state level.\"\n\nNew administration\n\nIt remains to be seen if this will change with incoming president Enrique Peña Nieto.\n\nThe list of more than 200 pledges from his new administration does not mention the victims of the violence, and he has given little indication of what steps he will take to improve their situation.\n\nThe list of necessities is a long one.\n\n\"Human rights have been ignored by this government and also at the local and state level\" - Daniel Zapico, Amnesty International\n\nThe majority of Mexico's states don't have the technology to do DNA testing and crime scenes are regularly tainted by untrained investigators.\n\nMany relatives of those disappeared think twice before going to local police forces, often fearing local officials may be in the pay of those who murdered their loved ones.\n\nPeña Nieto has talked of reforming and retraining police, just as his predecessor did. But rooting out corruption among badly paid and frequently uneducated local police has proved to be easier said than done.\n\nAll of which leaves Celerina without hope that the authorities will be able to find her husband. And she says that without help she can do no more.\n\n\"We can�", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_299", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "AMD’s server platform launch event this week in Austin, TX was indeed EPYC in more ways than one. All puns aside--and with appropriate amounts of “I’ll believe it when I see it” skepticism mixed in for good measure--the company’s Naples platform architecture, along with its EPYC 7000 series of multi-core server processors, has key advantages versus Intel’s current Xeon platform and likely the company’s Xeon Scalable next-gen offering as well. As I’ve highlighted previously, Naples, which is AMD’s internal code name for the EPYC server platform, stacks up really well in terms of core counts and processing resources but AMD’s PCIe expansion options, as well as raw memory bandwidth, are significantly more robust.\n\nAMD has already demonstrated that its X86 core performance is now roughly on par with Intel with the launch of its high-end Ryzen desktop processor chips, but now we see more clearly that Zen was built from the ground up as a highly scalable, modular server platform first and foremost. For servers, AMD not only has a core-count advantage with 32-core EYPC 7000 series chips at the top of its stack, versus Intel’s 22-core Xeon family (which is rumored to scale to 28-core next), but the platform also offers a full 128 lanes of dedicated PCI Express connectivity direct to the root CPU complex, no PCIe switches or bridges required. What this means is you can hang more high bandwidth co-processing devices off the CPU, like AMD’s new Radeon Instinct GPUs and FGPAs for that matter, without having to compromise raw throughput or latency. And then when you compare aggregate memory bandwidth and capacity with EPYC’s 8-channel memory controller versus Intel’s quad-channel design, again you see more opportunity to “feed the beast” as AMD put it several times this week in sunny Austin.\n\nAll that said, it’s not so much the technical advantages of EPYC/Naples, on paper, that have me bullish on the platform’s promise, it was the firm, committed show of support that major OEMs brought to the table for AMD EPYC at the show, with big guns like Dell and HP leading the way. Specifically, on stage AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su spent time with Antonio Neri, Executive VP and GM of Hewlett Packard Enterprise group, showcasing new HP servers based on EPYC and specific strengths versus Intel’s Xeon platform in Cloud services, Software Defined Storage and data analytics.\n\nFurther, Dell/EMC’s Server President and GM, Ashley Gorakhpurwalla took the stage with AMD’s Forrest Norrod, SVP and GM of AMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom group. Norrod and Gorakhpurwalla wheeled out a Dell/EMC PowerEdge server and demonstrated some of AMD’s new Secured Encrypted Virtualization technology to protect VMs against memory attacks and compromises, as well as EPYC’s one-socket server advantages with higher core counts and more flexible expansion options in Dell/EMC’s 14th generation of PowerEdge servers.\n\nAll told it was a proverbial dog and pony show for AMD EPYC, with not only a strong showing of big player system OEM support, but also independent hardware and software vendor support with names like SuperMicro, Xilinx, VMWare, Red Hat and Microsoft all stepping up to the plate as well.\n\nAMD’s EPYC server launch event was exactly what the company needed to show not just that major customers are kicking the tires with their new platform architecture, but that they’re strapped-in and buckled-up with committed systems in play and serious skin in the game. OEM partners at the event noted that AMD EPYC-based systems will ship in market in the second half of this year. How much share AMD will take is the $64,000 question but Intel’s lucrative Data Center group is the company’s high profit cash cow. If AMD is able to chip off even 10% share it could mean billions in new, high-margin business for the company.\n\nHere’s a quick video demo of some AMD EPYC server benchmarking at the event. Enjoy...\n\nDisclosure: I currently hold small positions in both INTC and AMD but in no way does this influence in my reporting on either company or its products.AMD’s server platform launch event this week in Austin, TX was indeed EPYC in more ways than one.

{"id": "sample_7_308", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Yesterday I received my Ephemera January Subscription Box! This is a brand new indie subscription box from the indie brand Aromaleigh. I have purchased from Aromaleigh in the past and was very pleased with the products I bought, the inspiration behind their themes, and their fast TAT. The Ephemera Subscription has limited slots so I'm very happy I was able to snag one!\n\nHere is some addition information about the sub from Aromaleigh's website:\n\nEphemera is a word of Greek origin that signifies something being of a short-lived nature, making it a perfect name for this offering. Each month will include a range of mini jar sizes of brand new, exclusively curated products, featuring a specific theme. Boxes will also include a sneak peek (or peeks) from upcoming product releases. The themed subscription products are exclusive to your monthly box, meaning that they will not be available at a later date for non-subscription members to purchase.\n\nMy box shipped on January 2 and arrived on the 5th. The price of the subscription is $17.99 with shipping for domestic subscribers.\n\n* Disclaimer: All products purchased with my own money unless otherwise stated. Thoughts and opinions are 100% my own. *\n\nThis month's theme was Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. I happen to love both the books and the films so I was happy with this theme! Not included in this photo is the sample perfume vial from Ten Three Labs, a sample blush from an upcoming Aromaleigh collection, and some candy that didn't survive the wait for swatches :P\n\nI think the packaging and labels of the products are cute. When I got it, this box was wrapped in a pretty ice blue bow. The box comes with a shadow guide explaining the products received and monthly theme.\n\nFrom left to right: The White Witch, 100 Years of Winter, Pale as Icing Sugar, Enchanted Turkish Delight (swatched heavily, blended out).\n\nFrom left to right: The White Witch, 100 Years of Winter, Pale as Icing Sugar, Enchanted Turkish Delight (swatched heavily, blended out).\n\nThe White Witch is a pale aqua shimmer with gold duochrome. I am always drawn to shades like these, they are just so pretty! Reminds me of Notoriously Morbid's Wayward Son. This color would pair well with the new shadow very well.\n\n100 Years of Winter is a smooth greened brown with white sparkles. Very accurate description, the white sparkles can almost look duochromatic at times. I can see his shade being used in conjunction with a lot of different shades so I feel like I'll get a lot of use out of this one as a crease shade to deepen up looks.\n\nPale as Icing Sugar is a metallic purple-leaning taupe. Here I've swatched it two ways as it is described as a multi-use product from shadow or face highlight. I particularly like how it looks blended out so I'm excited to try it out as highlight shade. I can see medium-deep skin tones using this as a very easy inner corner highlight shadow.\n\nEnchanted Turkish Delight is described as a winter berry with a teal glow. I didn't really see the teal glow in real life or in these photos but it still is a pretty blush. It's one of those shades that makes me you look naturally flushed, like you have been outside in the cold.\n\nIn my box I also recieved samples from two guest brands - Ten Three Labs and Dreamworld Hermetica. I am a huge fan of Dreamworld so I was excited to see they would be participating this month. I got a clamshell sample of their new liquid lipstick.\n\nWitches Heart is a metallic burnt orange with pink shimmer. THIS SHADE IS SO PRETTY! Such an interesting lipstick shade. I haven't tried it on my lips yet but I'm so stoked to test it out. It was actually quite difficult to get off my arm so I get the impression that it may have a longer wear time.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I really enjoyed the concept behind this month's box. The eyeshadows were all fairly cool-toned which went with the theme well. My favorites were Pale as Icing Sugar and the lipstick sample. I may pass along The White Witch as I have several similar shades. If I'm being completely honest, I wasn't wowed by this month's box but I am looking forward to next month's sub box. I know Aromaleigh does some amazing duochromes and purples so I hope we will see some more of those in the next coming months!Yesterday I received my Ephemera January Subscription Box!

{"id": "sample_7_320", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "ag who wrote that the white race is the cancer of human history.\" [Partisan Review, Winter 1967, p. 57] Susan Sontag was part of the Graetz legacy. He launched a propaganda campaign of \"scourging\" and \"flogging\" the majority demographic in his home country (Germany) in 1868, as well as a parallel propaganda campaign \"to shatter Christianity.\"\n\nWARNING: Here are some concepts not to use in an attackback. (1) Do not attack the entire demographic affinity group to which the slanderer belongs. We can't do it because we are fighting an attack on our entire demographic affinity group. (2) Do not use \"rational\" arguments based on logic (logic is dead in public discourse), the double standard (it's applauded by our adversaries), racism (it's been defined in a biased way), history (they twist it), fairness (not going to happen), and dictionary definitions (they distract from the state of mind of the slanderer). 3) Do not use \"irrational\" arguments based on being offended on the grounds that it is infantile and subjective. Attackback on objective grounds that explain that the slanderer opened his or her mind to us to determine as to whether the slanderer was lying, bigoted, a supremacist, a hater, a bully, or a dehumanizer. We have an entire section on the attackback in this syllabus.\n\nCASE STUDIES OF EXAMPLES: Anglo - This is an italicized Spanish-language epithet and claim of supremacy over diverse white Americans -- not shorthand for the English-language ethnic name Anglo-Saxon. It's also an expression of hatred. Goyim - This is a claim of supremacy over the diverse white Americans by claiming the right to label them and an attempt to smother white American diversity and nationality. The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted asylum in July 2003 to a Southwest Asian who claimed being called goy as an aspect of his persecution abroad. Ram HaCohen explained goyim on 4/10/10 by saying \"no matter how Jewish-friendly (and Israel-friendly) a nation has been historically, Israelis are encouraged to view all non-Jews (\"Goyim\" is the pejorative term used uncritically by most Hebrew speakers) as inherently anti-Semitic and therefore anti-Israeli.\" Gringo - This label is a claim of supremacy over white Euro-Americans; an expression of hatred; and a targeting term for violence. This was an important signifying slur during the huge Mexican May Day marches on 5/1/06.\n\nHaole - This is a claim to supremacy in Hawaii over the diverse white Americans by claiming the right to name and label them; and an expression of hatred.\n\nNon-Hispanic Whites - This is an expression of hatred by the dominant media culture, and an attempt to smother white American diversity and nationality. This term is sometimes defended as a US Census term but the haters who make that claim never use the parallel census terms -- non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic Indian.\n\nRedneck - This label is an expression of hatred for diverse white American rural dwelling people like mechanics, farmers, merchants, and farm workers, especially by the urban-coastal class. See Al Sharpton explain redneck and cracker. Begin at 50 on the video. Shiksa - This is a claim to supremacy over, and an act of bullying, the diverse white European American women by claiming the right to name and label them. See Israel Shahak's definition of shiksa, 1994, page 26 -- \"unclean animal; loathsome creature, abomination.\" Even Commentary magazine recognizes the vicious nature of shiksa. Typical White Person - A serious expression of hostility to white Americans' diversity, nationality, and right to self-name; and a disgraceful slander by then US Senator Obama on 3/20/08, just two days after his speech on race in Philadelphia on 3/18/08. White Boy - This is an expression of hatred for white American men, and an attempt to smother white Euro-American men's diversity, nationality, and continental origins. California State Assembly Member Paul Fong of Cupertino is most well-known locally for using this term to describe European American men. This term was used in 2012 to label Tucker Carlson by an employee of Fox News TV.\n\nWhite Skin Privilege - This is a Big Lie by extremists in academia, entertainment, and media claiming that all white Euro-Americans are equally successful in all walks of life, similar to the term \"model minority.\" This label is based on a claim to supremacy in naming; it is an example of bullying; it is based on raw hatred; it is a Big Lie; and it is profoundly dehumanizing.

{"id": "sample_7_323", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " her attorney attend a press conference at the health ministry on Oct. 7, 2016, after a labor standards inspection office in Tokyo recognized the suicide of Matsuri Takahashi as work-related. (Photo11: Kyodo News via AP)\n\nTOKYO — Matsuri Takahashi was just 24 years old and a graduate of prestigious Tokyo University when she leaped to her death from her company dormitory on Christmas Day last year.\n\nTokyo Labor Bureau investigators ruled her suicide karoshi — death by overwork.\n\nThe Labor Bureau announced on Oct. 7 that Takahashi had been required to work 100 hours or more of overtime per month for months on end at the prominent Dentsu advertising agency. She often got as little as two hours of sleep a night, rarely had a day off and was ordered by supervisors to report fewer hours than she actually worked.\n\nIt’s an all too familiar story in Japan, where employees at nearly one in four companies are at risk of dying from working too many hours, according to a government report issued last month.\n\nBut Takahashi’s case has struck a nerve in Japan, and could help hasten reforms that experts say are long overdue.\n\nLast Friday, Labor Ministry inspectors swooped down on Dentsu’s gleaming headquarters in central Tokyo and other sites around Japan, searching for evidence of systemic overtime abuse or other labor violations.\n\nThis was not the first such case at Dentsu. The 1991 suicide of a 24-year-old worker at company headquarters in Tokyo was among the first to focus national attention on the problem of karoshi.\n\n“There is definitely going to be an impact from this case,” said Naohiro Yashiro, an economist and professor of global business at Showa Women’s University in Tokyo. “Dentsu is a very big company and if these practices can continue to happen there, it means that it’s necessary to put (stronger) regulations in place.”\n\nThe Labor Ministry reports about 100 suicides per year due to karoshi — a number that Yashiro says represents “just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nOffice workers walk to the train after the days work on March 27, 2015, in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo11: Chris McGrath, Getty Images)\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe appointed an outside panel in September to recommend changes to Japan’s workplace environment, which includes excessive overtime.\n\nA Cabinet Office report issued last month found that employees at 23% of Japanese companies worked 80 hours or more of overtime per month last year. That’s the threshold at which the risk of death from physical or psychological causes is significant, according to the report.\n\nJapan’s Labor Standards Law currently mandates a 40-hour workweek and a maximum of 15 hours of weekly overtime. But the law effectively allows unlimited overtime if there is a written agreement between a company and its labor union (unions in Japan generally are organized at individual companies, rather than across industries or trades).\n\nAccording to a 2013 Labor Ministry report, companies with 300 or more employees on average allow up to 96.1 hours of overtime per month. That works out to roughly four and a half hours of overtime per day, every day.\n\nAccording to the Labor Ministry, Dentsu negotiated a maximum of 55 hours of overtime per month with its in-house labor union.\n\nBut investigators found that Takahashi, who worked in the company’s digital advertising division, had worked more than 100 hours of monthly overtime in the months preceding her death. Moreover, she had been instructed by supervisors to record no more than 70 hours of overtime per month, regardless of how much time she had actually worked.\n\nAttorneys for Takahashi’s parents said she worked as many as 130 hours of overtime in a single month.\n\n“My daughter was telling her friends and colleagues she would get only 10 hours of sleep in a single week, and the only thing she felt was just a desire to sleep. … Why did she have to die?” Takashi’s mother said in a television interview.\n\nDentsu released a statement saying the company could not comment directly on the Takahashi case, but it is “taking the suicide of an employee seriously.”\n\nA woman is seen leaving an office building on March 27, 2015. in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo11: Chris McGrath, Getty Images)\n\nDentsu, Japan’s largest advertising and public relations company, could be subject to criminal charges if investigators find evidence of systemic labor abuses, according to local news media.\n\nTakahashi joined Dentsu in 2015 after graduating from Tokyo University, considered one of Japan’s top universities.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to her death, she had", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_328", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " from Trump and the GOP. They're handling it by trolling them out of the middle class.\n\nIn Philadelphia in 2010. (Photo11: Jeff Fusco, Getty Images)\n\nFellow old people, imagine a candidate so lit that he’s backed by nearly three out of four voters ages 18 to 29. And imagine that the candidate getting your fam turnt (translation: your pals super excited) is not a YouTube star or a transgender activist determined to oppose cruel bathroom laws or (the way too conservative) Barack Obama in 2008. This new member of your squad is 60-year-old former Goldman Sachs executive Phil Murphy — who in January will become the first Democratic governor of New Jersey since 2009.\n\nMurphy’s fire (yeah, hot) performance with younger Millennial voters was nearly matched by 58-year-old Democrat Ralph Northam, a former Army surgeon and the next governor of the commonwealth of Virginia. He won about seven out of 10 voters ages 18 to 29, a group that doubled its turnout from 2009 to 2017. And like Murphy, he isn’t exactly the next Harry Styles.\n\nMore: Tax bill race to break Trump's populist promises: Who's winning?\n\nMore: Don't cut taxes for rich people like me: Walt Disney grandniece Abigail\n\nThe string of Democratic victories on Election Night 2017 falls well within the tradition of the party not holding the White House cleaning up in off-year elections. But what’s notable is that younger voters are generally mad AF at President Trump and ready to clap back at the ballot box — right as Millennials are prepared to eclipse Baby Boomers as America’s largest generation of eligible voters.\n\nWhile Trump is already historically unpopular for a new president, his appeal to America’s closest to death is keeping his ratings afloat, according to pollster William Jordan. Among younger voters, however, the president has already sunk to the level of George W. Bush in 2008 — after W had led America into the Hurricane Katrina debacle, two failed wars and the beginning of the Great Recession.\n\nAnd it was likely W’s repellence to younger voters as much as Obama’s appeal to them that helped Obama win 66% of the 18-to-29 vote in 2008 as young people flooded to the polls in numbers that hadn’t been seen since 18-year-olds got the vote in 1972.\n\nSo how is Trump’s GOP handling a hemorrhaging of young voters who are establishing voting patterns that could last the rest of their adult lives?\n\nBy trolling them out of the middle class.\n\nHow does the GOP tax plan, which has now passed the House and Senate in differing but rhyming versions, hurt young people?\n\nCosmopolitan’s Robin Marty counted the potential ways: higher taxes, more expensive student loans, rising insurance premiums, underfunded public schools, lower home values and a withering safety net.\n\n“What’s very clear through all of this is that the group that most pays are the younger people,” Eugene Steuerle, of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, told The Atlantic’s Ronald Brownstein.\n\nIt just makes sense that when you cut taxes for the richest Americans and corporations, the winners are the people who’ve had the longest time to accumulate wealth, businesses and stocks. In other words, older people. It’s the younger people, meanwhile, who are most likely to be punished by cuts Republicans will likely demand to pay for these tax giveaways and a deficit that was rising even before this budget-busting scheme — especially since they have continually promised to reserve cuts to social programs such as Medicare and Social Security for people who aren’t yet eligible for them.\n\nAnd the GOP tax plan is far from the party’s only policy that seems finely tuned to tick off the newest generation of voters.\n\nMore: Protect net neutrality and Internet freedom: World Wide Web inventor\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nRepealing \"net neutrality\" protections isn’t popular with voters from either party and could be especially disastrous for the Republican Party if it ends up compromising the Internet experience Millennials grew up expecting.\n\nThey don’t like obstacles to birth control, either. “Few Millennials have moral qualms about birth control, and they generally support policies to make contraception widely available and affordable,” according to a 2015 poll by the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nIn a new NBC News/GenForward poll, only 19% of Millennials identified with the Republican Party, and 71% said the GOP does not care about people like them.\n\nSure, there are still warning signs for the Democrats that Republicans’ collapse with young voters won’t translate into electoral gains.

{"id": "sample_7_329", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " about money. How do people understand money? How do they use money to express ideologies or to foster relationships?\n\nIn 2007/2008 I researched the interface between money and new technologies. When Bitcoin came along, I was in the middle of a study about mobile phones and money in sub-Saharan Africa. We were thinking about the implications of mobile phones on money. How do digital transactions change the conversations about mobile money, not in terms of security or encryption, but more in terms of cultural effects?\n\nAnd then came Bitcoin. I remember clearly: I was sitting in a cafe, working on something else with my students. Then someone told us about Bitcoin, we downloaded the original Satoshi whitepaper describing the concept, and from the beginning it was clear that we’d have to research this.\n\nWhat was the question of your research?\n\nThe first questions were: What is it? And why is it so interesting for people? We talked to technologists and scientists and found out that Bitcoin promises a future of nearly real time transactions, but in fact it will never be as fast as credit cards. And yet it is something a lot of people are interested in and invested money in. Why? What can Bitcoin tell us about money in the early 21th century? Why are people talking about money again?\n\nWhy in this specific historical moment had money become an issue again? How was Bitcoin capturing so much attention in this moment in the history of money.\n\n“Can we remake money? How can we make it different?”\n\nOne of the most disturbing experiences most people make with Bitcoin is that nobody is neutral. Everybody seems to be ideologically and emotionally involved. Did you find an explanation why?\n\nYes, I feel the same. The high level of emotional investment tells you something about the fact that money right now is being profoundly ungrounded. It is up for question. Since the end of World War II money had been relatively stable in people’s minds. But with the rise of the Internet and mobile and social computing, people are starting to think, if money is just data, just bits and bytes, can we remake money? How can we make it different? How can we think about it and value it?\n\nThere have been several different ways of thinking about money, different theories. Bitcoin reflects one of them. For several centuries the state was in the possession of the means of money making, but with the Internet, we can do it ourselves. This is not an idea Bitcoin brought into the world, it has existed for some time. Do you know the LETS movement?\n\nNo, what is it?\n\nIt stands for Local Exchange Trading System.\n\nAh, in Germany we call it “Tauschring”, I think.\n\nYes, wikipedia confirms this. Bitcoin is very similar to them. The LETS usually depend on a central account keeper. Bitcoin is similar in that it depends on accounts-keeping, but it eliminates the need for a central authority keeping track of transactions. So one strand of Bitcoin is very much like LETS, communitarian and mutualistic, but in the same time, and that’s a point of contradiction, Bitcoin is doing this without the need for trust. Community means usually trust, trust in leaders, in the people making up the community, but in Bitcoin it’s just trust in code.\n\nOn the other side, what is also interesting with Bitcoin, is that it continues a long history of thinking money as a natural commodity like gold.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThis line of thought thinks that money to be valuable it needs to be a commodity and it needs to be scarce. In the history of money this is a weird decision.\n\nSorry? What?\n\nIt’s weird because money has depended for a long time on credit and debt. In the west we also have over the centuries the imagination of money as a natural commodity.\n\nYou think money as a commodity is not a realistic option, but a wish and imagination?\n\nYes, it goes back to our origin story of money in the west. In our origin story, it begins with bartering, but barter becomes difficult, when I don’t have what you need. So the idea is that we need some kind of standard of value everyone can agree to. Here it gets tricky, for people who believe in money as a natural commodity, that people like something like gold and silver as money, because it’s rare and shiny …\n\n“That money needs to be scarce however is an idea from goldbugs.”\n\nBut gold and silver have been used for a long time as money.\n\nIt was not used as much as people think. All you need is a system of IOUs [= I Owe U], what means debts. The Babylonians mostly recorded transactions on tablets, without the need for gold and silver.", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_331", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " endorsing Process thought, because I'm still working through it and probably am closer to Open Theism than Process at this moment. That said, I'm looking forward to reading these essays and Bruce's new full-length treatment of Process Theology because I think it has promise for the present day theological questions, but unfortunately many works on Process are so philosophically dense they're difficult to understand. So, I invite you to consider Bruce's vision of the liberating God of Process Theology -- even if you don't even know who Alfred North Whitehead is!\n\nLiberating Process #2:\n\nLiberating God- An Open System\n\nBruce Epperly\n\nFor the next few weeks, we will be reflecting on process theology’s understanding of God. For many people, God’s perfection is defined in terms of changelessness. God is utterly complete. God knows the past, present, and future in one all-encompassing eternal now. Since God is always active rather than passive, God’s awareness of the world is creative in nature. Accordingly, the God who knows the future also creates the future. In the spirit of Rick Warren, all of the important events of our lives – from DNA, family of origin, and critical events, both positive and negative – have been determined by God without our input.\n\nFor many people, this image of perfection is good news. They define perfection in terms of changelessness and independence. An unchanging God, who knows and determines the future, is the ultimate source of security, even if that security is bought at the price of a god who causes cancer, car accidents, childhood trauma, and planetary cataclysm. But, a God who determines everything is morally ambiguous, at least from our standpoint. Whatever God does is good, from this standpoint, even if God’s action involves malignancy and catastrophe. While some suggest that we can never judge God, surely this image of God as all-determining fails the test of good parenting, established by Jesus. It is difficult to say that a god who causes childhood cancer represents any type of positive parenting, even if we believe that such action is for our own good and creates character in the human parent and child who must endure pain, anxiety, and serious medical interventions. Is a god who has determined pain and tragedy in advance truly on our side?\n\nThe problem with unchanging perfection is simply that “it doesn’t change.” Imagine a god for whom nothing new happens, who can’t revise “his” plans, and who is locked into “his” previous decisions. This god lacks the creativity and freedom that we attribute to one another. Such a god could hardly be interesting even to godself! A god, for whom nothing new occurs, who is not occasionally “surprised” by the events of life, lives in a perpetual “Ground Hog Day,” in which – like the movie’s protagonist – God must relive the same events over and over again.\n\nProcess theology suggests another option – an open-source, open-system vision of the universe in which God and the world exist in a dynamic, growing, and evolving partnership. A god for whom new things occur is a god that is open to creativity, love, and adventure. Rather than being caught in the past, God’s mercies are new every morning. God is constantly doing new things in relationship to the world. In the dynamic call and response of God and the world, God calls, we respond, leading to more activity on God’s part. A god who is liberated from changeless perfection is able to plan new things and embody them in new ways. We matter to a god who is lively and intimate in relationship with the world. Our prayers can make a difference and so can our actions because we add something new to God’s experience of the world.\n\nSome ask if a changing god lacks the fidelity many associate with changeless perfection. If God has not chosen the future, can God be counted on to save us when we are in distress? This is an important question, and process theology asserts that fidelity is not a matter of determinism but companionship. The process God can’t ensure a happy ending, but this God is constantly and consistently faithful in seeking our well-being. This God doesn’t cause cancer, but works within the responses of physicians, both Western and complementary, the prayers of loved ones, and the persons living with cancer to bring about healing and wholeness. God can’t guarantee a cure, but God can guarantee companionship and care.\n\nThe Living God is an open-source, open-spirit, open-relationship divinity. Liberated from unchanging perfection, God can do new things to bring healing, wholeness, and justice to the world.

Their sharp chrome bumpers and bold grilles might not be ideal for aerodynamics or pedestrian safety, but they sure do look good.\n\nThe problems with owning a classic car start when you climb behind the wheel. Most pre-1960 classics struggle to drive at highway speeds for extended periods of time and braking must be done months in advance to prevent flying through a red light. What are people supposed to do when they want that cool 1950’s style but still need a daily driver? Jonathan Ward of ICON in California thinks he might have the answer: Why not have an unassuming-looking vintage car with modern underpinnings?\n\nThere is a shop in California that brings rusty classics into the modern age. It's called ICON customs Clayton Seams , Driving\n\nThe ICON workshop is always busy and full of various classics getting the ICON treatment. Clayton Seams , Driving.ca\n\nThe bench seats are actually specially filled with high and low density foam to create a bucket seat effect while maintaining the classic look. Clayton Seams , Driving.ca\n\nThis Buick uses a supercharged Corvette engine. Note the hand aged plastic cover. Clayton Seams , Driving.ca\n\nThe weathered finish of the Derelicts is preserved instead of being painted over. Clayton Seams , Driving.ca\n\nThe waiting list to get your very own ICON Derelict is more than two years. Clayton Seams , Driving.ca\n\n“The problem with older cars,” Ward says, “is that you’re a martyr to them.”\n\nWard realized early on that using a stock 1950’s car as daily transportation was fraught with issues, so he decided to build a 1950’s car of his own. He started with a 1952 Chrysler station wagon that had a lovely rusted and faded patina and added the front clip of a similarly aged DeSoto. Then he got creative.\n\nThe ancient Chrysler underpinnings were replaced with an advanced Art Morrison chassis with modern suspension and powerful disc brakes, then a modern 6.1-litre Dodge Hemi was placed under the hood.\n\nThis is the point where most hot rodders would paint the wagon a deep metallic red and add modern leather bucket seats to the interior. But Ward did the opposite. He clear-coated the original faded paint on the wagon to preserve it and kept the original layout of the interior. He retained the pizza-sized steering wheel and made all the antique chrome switches and knobs work with a modern climate control system.\n\nIt started out as a personal project, but when he was finished, he realized, “This is ICON,” and he turned it into a business.\n\nThe car went on to win multiple awards, made it onto an episode of Jay Leno’s Garage, was featured on the cover of Hot Rod magazine and soon enough, requests starting pouring in from people who wanted their very own “brand new” beat-up hot rod.\n\nWard calls these cars the Derelicts and if you want one, you have to put down a hefty deposit and then wait more than two years before they can even start work on your car. But when you see these cars up close, it’s easy to see why people are willing to wait.\n\nThe attention to detail borders insanity. Every visual cue of the cars’ modern underpinnings are carefully hidden. One customer wanted a centre armrest with a modern big-gulp sized cupholder and a charge port for his iPhone. Ward says it took over 140 hours to design, prototype, cad plate and upholster. And that was just for the armrest! Even the bench seats, which look low-tech, feature different kinds of foam to create a bucket sensation as you sit on them with a subtle bolstering effect. It’s easy to walk around one of these cars for hours just soaking in the details.\n\nThe fact that these cars don’t require intensive maintenance opens up the market for a whole new buying demographic. Many of the people who buy ICON Derelicts aren’t the type who spend their weekends rebuilding engines on their kitchen table, but are a new kind of enthusiast that want classic style with modern drivability.\n\nBut the Derelicts are just one part of ICON’s business. ICON started out as a company making off-road parts for Toyota Land Cruisers and today they make turn-key Land Cruisers and Ford Broncos with modern components. But their off-roaders have paint. Of course, they’ll still make you a Derelict should you wish, but Ward acknowledges that the Derelict cars are “the dumbest business thing we do” because of the insane amount of time it takes to build each one.\n\nThere are, of course, people who don", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

Asher Callender, a senior at Bushwick Community High School, had to go to court on Friday, only to have his case postponed again until March 3.\n\nThese are not gangsters. These are not drug dealers. These are kids who were trying to go to a wake for a friend. It was not the kids who were out of control, it was the criminal justice system, which can’t seem to tell the difference between right and wrong, between the truth and deliberate lies, or between justice on the one hand and gratuitously cruel behavior by public officials on the other.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll the charges in this case should be dropped and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who apparently wants to be mayor of this city, and District Attorney Hynes should offer the kids a public apology.\n\nThe authorities have become accustomed to treating disadvantaged young people in New York City like dirt and getting away with it. In this case, local school officials, community residents and the civic group Make the Road New York rallied to the youngsters’ cause.\n\nNeither the police nor the district attorney expected to be confronted in any kind of sustained way over their treatment of these kids. Mr. Hynes said on the radio program: “None of these kids are going to be prosecuted. They’re not going to go to jail ... We are going to offer every one of them community service.”\n\nWhat he meant was that he expected the kids to go quietly, to plead guilty and passively accept the blot on their records and what he thought of as mild punishment.\n\nBut the kids had a surprise for him. They refused to plead guilty to something they hadn’t done. Ten of them are still paying the price for standing up for themselves.The youngest person arrested was 13. All of the kids were handcuffed, cursed at and humiliated, and several spent 30 hours or more in jail.\n\nTo date, there has been no evidence produced — no witnesses, no photographs or videotapes, no dented vehicles or broken mirrors, nothing whatsoever — to indicate that any of the youngsters had done anything at all that was wrong.\n\nHow is it that you can have a rampage in broad daylight on a street in New York City and not be able to show in any way that the rampage occurred?\n\nPhoto\n\nAt least 22 of the 32 people arrested have had their charges dismissed or were never formally charged at all.

{"id": "sample_7_335", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " as Hugh Pym reports\n\nThousands of foreign nurses working in junior posts in the UK could be forced to return home under new immigration rules, union leaders have warned.\n\nA new pay threshold for migrants means non-European workers will have to leave the UK after six years if they are not earning at least £35,000.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing said the rules would \"cause chaos\" for the NHS and waste money spent on recruitment.\n\nThe Home Office said the rules would help reduce demand for migrant labour.\n\nAnd Prime Minister David Cameron even got drawn into the issue, saying more homegrown nurses were in the process of being recruited.\n\nThe move is part of the government's effort to control net migration, but the union says that by 2017 more than 3,300 NHS nurses could be affected.\n\nAnd by the end of the decade the numbers could be double that - a potential waste of nearly £40m when all the costs of recruitment are taken into account, the RCN says.\n\nThere are more than 400,000 nurses working in the NHS and over 600,000 registered to work.\n\nThe warning comes as the RCN's annual conference gets under way in Bournemouth.\n\nMore difficult\n\nRCN general secretary Peter Carter said: \"The immigration rules will cause chaos for the NHS and other care services.\n\n\"At a time when demand is increasing, the UK is perversely making it harder to employ staff from overseas.\"\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move was \"totally illogical\" as there is currently a \"major shortage of nurses\", leading to many NHS trusts spending \"tens of millions\" to recruit from overseas.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption RCN's Peter Carter: \"[Foreign nurses] will have to leave their homes in the UK, many of them now have families here... it's a truly deplorable state of affairs\"\n\nDr Carter also stressed that most nurses earn \"nowhere near\" £35,000, with most on salaries of between £21,000 and £28,000 a year.\n\nDue to cuts to nurse-training places, trusts are being forced into relying on overseas recruitment as well as temporary staff just to provide safe staffing.\n\nThe long-term solution is to train more nurses in the UK, but in the interim, foreign nurses filled the gap, he added.\n\nNurse pay and roles Band Pay range Typical role 5 £21,692 - £28,180 Entry level nurse or midwife 6 £26,041 - £34,876 Staff nurse, such as theatre nurse 7 £31,072 - £40,694 Senior nurse, such as ward sister / team leader 8 £39,632 - £81,618 Nurse consultant or matron\n\nSource: Royal College of Nursing and NHS England\n\nHe said of the new rules: \"It can't be morally or ethically right but will also have a huge impact on the ability of the health service to carry on in the way it has.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"As the prime minister has made clear, the government wants to reduce the demand for migrant labour.\n\n\"We changed the settlement rules in 2011 to break the link between coming to work in the UK and staying here permanently.\"\n\nHe said employers had had four years to prepare for the changes, adding: \"There are exemptions to this threshold where the UK has a shortage.\"\n\nAt the moment nurses are not on that exemption list, but the spokesman said it was possible they could still be added if evidence showed this was needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Cameron said he did not believe the immigration rules would lead to a shortfall of nurses.\n\n\"We have got a massive training programme for nurses at the moment, there are something like 8,000 more nurses in the NHS today than when I became Prime Minister. The training programme will continue,\" he said.\n\n\"But, crucially, we have an organisation called the Migration Advisory Committee and they advise us about which occupations to put on the so-called shortage occupations list, the ones where they fear skills shortages will develop.\n\n\"They haven't put nursing on that shortage occupation list and I think we should listen to their advice above all.\"\n\nAnalysis - Hugh Pym, BBC health editor\n\nNursing shortages and spiralling agency costs have generated intense pressures on hospital finances. Calls by regulators for higher staff numbers following scandals such as mid- Staffs have resulted in higher demand for nurses at a time of limited supply.\n\nIn effect, the RCN is saying the Government is shooting itself in the foot by pursuing a policy which could squeeze the supply of nurses even further. Making nurses from outside the European Economic Area quit the UK if they don't earn enough could deter their compatriots from seeking work here at a time of rising demand for qualified nurses in most leading economies.\n\n", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1023}}

It’s actually quite an exciting idea.”\n\nCountries using forms of e-voting include the US, Brazil, Belgium, Estonia, the Philippines and India. The term “e-voting” includes online voting where electors can cast their ballot from any computer using a secure ID.\n\nElectronic voting began in the 1960s, with the use of punched card systems. Since then, more modern systems have been introduced and include electronic machines in polling stations operated by buttons or touchscreens which connect to a central database.\n\nGraham Allen, the Labour chair of the political and constitutional reform committee, said: “Parliament more than any other institution has to show it wants to improve our democracy. That’s why I warmly welcome Mr Speaker’s initiative to make parliament and our democracy more relevant to the digital age. This is a radical package of reforms essential to revive the health of our democracy.”Commission set up by House of Commons Speaker also says there should be live social media coverage of debates\n\nPeople should be offered the opportunity to cast their vote online in the 2020 general election, a commission set up by House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has said.\n\nThe Digital Democracy Commission also recommends that MPs could be questioned through an internet forum to enable the public to take part in Commons debates.\n\nThe report also recommends that MPs who are unwell or have childcare responsibilities should be able to vote in the Commons electronically, without having to go into the chamber.\n\nThe commission recommends ending restrictions on members of the public using mobile phones in the public galleries in the Commons and said the house should experiment with providing live social media coverage of debates.\n\nMoves to make it possible to casting a ballot online in elections by 2020 would be complemented by changes in political education in schools in an effort to encourage young people to register to vote.\n\nThe report follows a general decline in voter participation in general elections since the second world war.\n\nIn 2012, just 14% of voters turned out for the first ever elections for police and crime commissioners – the worst in British political history for a nationwide poll", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_357", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "We need to pair migrants with particular skills to areas with labour shortages\n\nBritain’s population is growing. New estimates out this week reveal a 0.77 per cent population increase across the UK at the mid-point of 2014, higher than the 10-year average.\n\nThe rise is down to both a higher number of births than deaths (accounting for 46 per cent of the increase) and positive net migration (accounting for 53 per cent).\n\nBritain benefits from migration – not least because migrants support our ageing society by helping to grow the economy, reduce the deficit and finance public services.\n\nBut significant numbers are concerned that the country is overcrowded. Indeed, Britain has one of the highest population densities in Europe.\n\nAnd though the latest increase is not only down to a rise in inward migration, it is clear that net migration is having a sustained impact on population levels.\n\nStill, Britain can cope with the current increase: the OBR has said that urban Britain ‘occupies less than 10 per cent of the surface area’ and density is relatively low by historical standards.\n\nThere is enough space for more houses if we are prepared to build them: building enough homes to accommodate the expected increase in people would mean that 12 or 13 per cent of land in England – rather than around 10 per cent- would be developed.\n\nPopulation growth will of course be felt in some parts of the country, but it will not be felt everywhere. Breaking down the data reveals a much more mixed picture than the aggregate figures suggest.\n\nIn parts of Wales and Northern England – such as Cumbria and North Yorkshire – population levels are falling due to relatively low birth rates and low or negative levels of net migration (both international and internal).\n\nOn the other hand, parts of the South East and the Midlands have recently experienced very high levels of population growth. Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney, Islington and Corby are the five local authorities that have had the greatest growth over the past ten years.\n\nIn other areas – such as Manchester and Birmingham – population levels appear relatively stable but this masks considerable churn.\n\nThe latest figures also highlight Britain’s ageing population. There has been a rise in the median age to 40 – a jump of more than 6 years since 1974.\n\nBut again the impacts of ageing are uneven across the country. In areas with growing populations like Slough, Hackney and Tower Hamlets, the median age is far lower than average, while coastal areas tend to have greater numbers of older people.\n\nThe key challenge is therefore not that there are too many people in the UK, but that there are considerable imbalances across the country.\n\nIn some places local authorities are dealing with sustained pressure on public services; in others, they are struggling to retain skilled workers.\n\nIn order to address these imbalances, we need to do two things. First, local authorities facing high levels of flux and churn need greater support in easing pressures on public services.\n\nBefore the election, the Conservatives promised they would introduce a new Migration Control Fund for local authorities. This fund should target support services and address needs in particular areas where inward migration is creating pressures.\n\nSecond, local authorities with declining or stagnating populations would benefit from a better pairing of migrants arriving with particular skills to areas with labour shortages.\n\nGermany’s shrinking population has incentivised localities to develop creative ways to utilise migration in order to boost their economies – with different cities competing for migrant labour through advertising, better international transport links, and targeted integration policies aiming to get migrants settled into work (such as guidance given to newcomers for setting up new businesses).\n\nAsylum seekers, many of whom arrive highly-qualified, are also being dispersed to areas with high labour demand.\n\nIn the US, cities with declining populations such as Pittsburgh and Cleveland have come up with new strategies for attracting migrants to revitalise their economies – from targeting migrant community groups with job advertisements to producing webinars to support employers with visa administration for international students.\n\nLocal authorities suffering from demographic and economic decline could draw on some of these strategies to ensure migrants fill labour gaps, in order to both facilitate local economic growth and alleviate pressures in other parts of Britain.\n\nThese steps would go some way to addressing local imbalances and helping to ease public concerns. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to think that reducing net migration dramatically would seriously tackle population worries.\n\nInstead, it would risk accelerating population ageing and, in some areas, adding to population decline– which would amount to a much greater demographic challenge.\n\nMarley Morris is a researcher at IPPR.

{"id": "sample_7_359", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " accept playing Masters to nothing more than pick-up league fodder. It’s unlikely anything will ever change that.\n\nDespite the fact that players like James Hron or Sarah Carnahan would be just as much of a headache to guard in their respective single-gender divisions, this thinking remains. Despite the fact that ultimate is maybe the only sport in the world to be played at an elite level in co-ed and should thus perhaps be viewed with pride, this thinking remains.\n\nI’m not saying there isn’t a case to be made that men’s or women’s is more competitive, or elite, or something along those lines. All I’m saying is that two people getting high does not ratify the illegitimacy of a division any more than it does the sport as a whole.\n\nAnd as for the question of how it reflects on ultimate in general, perhaps that can best be answered by Seattle Mixed coach Jamie Arambula.\n\n“In the NFL, you have people getting shitfaced all the time,” he said. “Guys shoot someone or fight someone. Guys beat up their wives. Does that un-legitimize their sport?”\n\nAs a veteran who’s played for top clubs like Santa Barbara Condors and Seattle Sockeye and done crazy things like attend 30 tournaments in a single year, for two years in a row, Arambula has been around the ultimate scene.\n\nHe said that every ultimate team he’s known, even the elite ones, has at least one player that does drugs, including at premier tournaments. But, Arambula was quick to note, that doesn’t mean they don’t take their team or the game seriously.\n\nIf anything it just makes them adults and humans, some with different preferences than others.\n\nThough he doesn’t condone drug use, Arambula said that the matter comes down to personal responsibility more than anything else.\n\n“From my perspective as a coach, I don’t want anyone doing anything to affect their performance,” Arambula said. “But if someone is gonna do something, they’re adults. That’s on them. You’re an adult, you can make those choices.”\n\nThis idea seems especially important.\n\nIn contrast to leagues like the NFL or NBA, where players are under multi-million dollar contracts, agree to act as representatives of the organization and the sport, and have hordes of analysts scrutinizing everything they do, the issue of a small drug incident might have a little more weight.\n\nYet, even those flare-ups usually fall by the wayside in the wake of larger issues like weapons charges and domestic abuse, or even the next day’s news cycle.\n\nBut ultimate is different.\n\nNot just because there’s no big money or lofty prestige in it. Or because there’s thankfully much less assault and drug offenses. Ultimate is different because players and organizers still have a great deal of say in how we define our sport and what we want it to be.\n\nSo when ordeals like what happened on Saturday evening of Nationals occur, we can decide our own reaction to it and decide what it might actually mean and say about our community as a whole, rather than falling back on pre-scripted responses dictated by vague social norms or sensationalist pundits performing for ratings and fake respect.\n\nWe can look at two people getting wrecked by pot brownies as a disgrace if we really want to look at it that way. That’s not entirely crazy. We can also look at it as unfortunate mistakes made by two of our friends. Adults that made poor choices and suffered the consequences for it.\n\nPerhaps we could go even further and think about elements of the larger context. For instance, unlike just about every other sport, in ultimate if you come out of nowhere and qualify for the national championship game, you really only have a few hours to (modestly) celebrate it.\n\nYou don’t get the chance to get ripped with your teammates that night, then come back the next day (or more likely the day after next) and get back to training for the big show.\n\nIn this way, when we look at the choices of a few Seattle Mixed players—and when we keep in mind that this was the first time that all but two of their players had made the trip to Club Nationals—and their decision to celebrate as hard as they played, maybe it’s not so crazy.\n\nYes, most of us would probably have done different. Maybe just a beer or two. Or maybe just a shared joint rather than the unpredictable grenades that are edibles.\n\nBut does that mean we should demonize these young people or take their actions as a sign that what we all love, regardless of", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_364", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " incessantly on the family’s door in Gladstone, Ore., she says.\n\nPurchase says she never sought or anticipated this kind of attention. She and her boyfriend, Brandon Krenzler, whom Mykayla calls “daddy,” always knew they would obtain a medical marijuana card if their daughter needed one, she says. When oncologists diagnosed the 7-year-old with an aggressive form of cancer known as T-cell leukemia earlier this summer, Purchase and Krenzler drove Mykayla to The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation clinic in Southeast Portland and got her enrolled in the state program.\n\nPurchase and Krenzler tell The Daily Beast they aren’t the least bit embarrassed or ashamed of their actions. They’re convinced the cannabis oil their daughter now ingests in two pills each day not only has mitigated the effects of her chemotherapy but also perhaps knocked her leukemia into remission. But they made sure those early visits to the clinic where Mykayla gets her medicine were “discreet,” through a side entrance, they say. They did not tell the girl’s biological father, who they say has been out of touch for most of the child’s life. They kept it quiet, to themselves.\n\nNow they’re famous. And they’re being attacked, they say, by people who don’t understand the power of marijuana as medicine, who call them lousy parents, who’ve seized on the comment Jesse Comstock, the girl’s biological father, made in that first newspaper article—that he visited in August and found his daughter “stoned out of her mind.”\n\nComstock couldn’t be reached for comment for this story, but he’s not the only one nonplussed that each month little Mykayla consumes the distilled equivalent of a pound of marijuana, which remains classified by the federal government as a Schedule 1 narcotic, right up there with LSD and heroin. Purchase and Krenzler say the oncologist who was treating Mykayla “blew up on us” when she found out about the cannabis use and that the doctor-patient relationship became so strained they asked for a new provider. (Neither the girl’s new oncologist nor her previous doctor returned phone calls from The Daily Beast.) The couple—he a handyman in between “technical” jobs, she a hemp jewelry maker—also say they’ve received vile emails from people declaring them not just unfit parents but also deserving of jail time.\n\n“I hope they never have to be who I am,” Purchase says. “I hope they never have to feel what I’m having to feel, what she’s having to feel. I’m not drugging my child. I use this for her medicine. It’s amazing, and I think people should know that.”\n\nBut the two have discovered something else about being in the national spotlight: an overwhelming show of support, from all over the country. The number of “likes” on Mykayla’s Facebook page has tripled in the past few weeks, to 5,000. A call for donations to help the couple replace their broken-down car hit $2,000 last week, only a few days after the “Fairy Godparent Car Rally” began.\n\nOne of Mykayla’s roommates also gives her $1 every time she muscles down a shot of “cannabis juice,” a liquid derived from the plant that has no intoxicating effects—because it isn’t heated—but is unpalatable. Mykayla says she’s saving those dollars for a “Build-A-Bear” she’s making for her 17-month-old sister, Ryleigh.\n\nThose who support Mykayla’s cannabis use do so either because they’ve long believed in the plant’s healing powers or because they’re hip to mounting medical evidence that shows marijuana’s “cannabinoids” don’t just help with generalized pain, nausea, and diminished appetite but have been shown to slow cancer growth, inhibiting the formation of new blood cells that feed tumors. Some of Purchase and Krenzler’s critics are upset that they don’t treat the girl exclusively with cannabis, he says, but the couple isn’t willing to go that far.\n\nThe trouble is, there’s also research that shows marijuana use can have negative effects, especially among those who begin using the drug before they turn 18. “Persistent cannabis use” among young people was associated with “neuropsychological decline,” a Duke University survey of more than 1,000 individuals at various", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

His goals were scored in 30 games, at a ratio of one every 87 minutes.\n\nWhat's even more remarkable about Kane's feats this term (four against Leicester and three at Hull in the final two games eventually getting him over the line) is that he reached these remarkable heights despite missing two chunks of the season with separate ankle injuries.\n\nThese ailments forced him to miss eight league games, but what's incredible isn't just that he missed those two spells, but more the speed of his recovery. In September it was predicted he'd miss two months, but he was back in a little over six weeks; there were similar fears in March, but ultimately he returned after a month. And he scored in his first game back both times, too.\n\nThere is often a tendency in England to overhype players, but in Kane's case there's a sense he's underrated. By any rational standard, Kane is world-class, even if that is a nebulous term without clear definition. We are, after all, perfectly prepared to place players like Alexis Sanchez, Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero into that bracket, but Kane isn't routinely classed among the finest in the world.\n\nWith the caveat that goals aren't the sole marker of players' class, Kane has scored more than all of those players this season. In the last three seasons, he has scored 75 in the Premier League, ahead of Aguero, on 70. Throw in another three the season before, plus 21 in other competitions, and his career total for Tottenham is 99, from 131 starts. There's enough evidence to confirm his status now.\n\nAt first glance, he still doesn't look particularly special -- despite being a fine athlete he doesn't have a single \"eye-catching\" physical quality, like pace, rippling power or a bullet header -- but something intangible marks him out, specifically that he thinks in a different way to many footballers.\n\nWhen he's in the box, his brain appears to work in a way that can calculate the best and quickest way to score a goal, a common element of elite strikers, as is his sense of positioning, awareness of space and anticipation that another Tottenham No. 10, Gary Lineker, was famous for. But Kane also seems to think laterally, to figure out what the defence hasn't anticipated, weighing up all the options and making a decision, all in a flash of a second. It's a dazzling form of intelligence that is comparable to any intellectual.\n\nPerhaps \"thinking\" isn't the right word. \"It's instinct, natural,\" he said in February. \"When that ball drops to me my body takes over and my mind is just blank, really. I couldn't tell you what is in my head at that moment because, really, there is nothing, only focus.\"\n\nIt's a speed of comprehension and logic that most can't even contemplate -- so quick that it barely seems conscious.\n\n\"How does it happen? We don't really know...\" he said.\n\nIf he doesn't know what he's about to do, then defenders certainly won't.\n\nTake his goal against Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal. A cross was delivered from the right to about waist-level, with Kane running away from goal at the near post. He knew the angle and height of the ball would make a shot unlikely to threaten the goal, even if he caught it perfectly. So instead Kane stooped and flicked his neck muscles at just the right time for the ball to divert off his head, directly over him and into the bottom corner.\n\nThe speed at which he assessed the situation, the delivery and the best way to score was astonishing. It wasn't that the Chelsea defence weren't expecting it, more that they probably hadn't comprehended scoring like that was even possible.\n\nThink also of his goal against Liverpool last season, or the one for England against Germany. They were brilliant finishes; ones most players wouldn't even have thought of. The best players have this mentality: what looks unusual or outrageous to us, in their heads is usually just the easiest way of beating a man, or picking a pass, or scoring a goal.\n\nHarry Kane has secured back-to-back golden boots for Tottenham. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nHis goals in Tottenham's 7-1 win at Hull in the final game of the season provide another example. Kane, a natural right-footer, scored all three with his left, in situations where he could easily have shifted his body, or taken another touch to shoot with his stronger foot.

Andrej has worked to give computers vision through his work on ImageNet, as well as imagination through the development of generative models, and the ability to navigate the internet with reinforcement learning. He was most recently a Research Scientist at OpenAI. Andrej completed his computer vision PhD at Stanford University, where he demonstrated the ability to derive complex descriptions of images using a deep neural net. For example, identifying not simply that there is a cat in a given picture, but that it is an orange, spotted cat, riding on a skateboard with red wheels on brown hardwood flooring (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/main.pdf). He also created and taught “Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition,” the first and still leading deep learning course at Stanford.”\n\nYou know it’s a good hire when even the competition agrees:\n\nAnd hires like this are why the other car companies don't have a chance. https://t.co/4UqEWs8ISK — comma ai (@comma_ai) June 21, 2017\n\nThe company also commented on Lattner’s departure.

{"id": "sample_7_373", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " ratified it so that it came into force. At that point, according to the terms of the agreement, the U.S. would be unable to withdraw until November 2020. This guaranteed that if a GOP president announced that he intended to withdraw from the pact, climate would become a top campaign issue in the 2020 election.\n\nThat’s exactly what Trump did on June 1 when he announced he did intend to withdraw, delighting many conservatives and angering Democrats who said it was a rejection of global leadership. Despite his announcement, the U.S. is likely to remain in the deal for the next three years. Trump does have one other option to remove the U.S. from the Paris deal immediately: Pull out of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the umbrella agreement under which all these negotiations take place. But he hasn’t taken that step, so the U.S. technically remains in the Paris deal even as other countries take on the mantle of leadership on climate change.\n\nIran. Over and over on the campaign trail, Trump called the Iran nuclear agreement the “worst deal ever.” But since taking office, he appears to have decided that ending the deal would be worse than keeping it. Twice—first in April and then again on Monday—Trump officially certified that Iran is upholding its responsibilities under the deal. But the Trump administration has also taken a tough line with Tehran, imposing new sanctions on individuals connected with Iran’s ballistic missile program and publicly blasting the Islamic Republic for its human rights abuses. Such actions mark a break with Obama’s policy, but the nuclear agreement remains in place.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan. The focal point of Obama’s domestic climate legacy is the Clean Power Plan, which he announced in August 2015. The regulation is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and requires states to meet certain emissions targets, but due to lawsuits the rule never took effect. So far, Trump hasn't rolled back Obama's plan, though he's strongly signaled he intends to repeal it, and the administrative gears are turning: He directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review the plan; the EPA has already finished that review and sent its resulting rule, which is expected to recommend repeal, to the White House for review. If Trump follows through and repeals the Clean Power Plan, it will be a real blow to Obama’s climate legacy.\n\nImmigration. Obama has a complicated history on immigration, having deported more people than any other president, infuriating activists who labeled him the “deporter-in-chief.” But later in his presidency, he implemented a new immigration directive under which nearly 90 percent of undocumented immigrants weren’t considered priorities for deportation. And he also created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected millions of undocumented kids from deportation. Trump has partially reversed that legacy by directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to draw up new priorities that cast a much wider net and stepping up the number of deportations. But the president has also disappointed immigration hard-liners in one key way: He’s left DACA in place.\n\nCuba. Over the last few years of his presidency, Obama renewed diplomatic relations with the island, relaxing rules on travel and commerce. Trump vowed to end those policies as president and made a big show of doing so in a June speech in Miami. Only one problem: Much of Obama’s opening is unaffected by Trump’s executive order; he isn’t closing the embassy in Havana or stopping the burgeoning relations between the countries.\n\nWall Street regulations. Obama’s legacy also includes Dodd-Frank, the financial regulatory law passed in the wake of the financial crisis that imposed new rules on banks and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While Trump promised during the campaign to dismantle Dodd-Frank, the law was never at risk of repeal since many changes would require Democratic votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nBut Trump has also backpedaled on his disdain for the law. In June, the Treasury Department released its first of a series of reports on financial regulations, proposing to make targeted changes to Dodd-Frank but leaving its broad structure in place. The law isn’t exactly safe: Republicans are still looking to change the law through reconciliation, which allows them to make tax and spending changes with just a simple majority, and regulators have some authority to weaken some Obama-era financial regulations on banks. But the law isn’t at risk of being “dismantled.” It’s here to stay.\n\nNOW WHAT? TRUMP can’t abolish Obamacare from the White House, but as president, he still has the power to unilaterally blow up many of Obama’s biggest achievements. He could cut off the cost-sharing subsidies for low-income Americans, which health care experts say would almost certainly cause the Obamacare markets to collapse. He could pull out of the U.N.

{"id": "sample_7_374", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Israel and the US are set to collaborate in cybersecurity, a senior White House official said at a conference in Tel Aviv Monday.\n\n“I announce today the commencement of an Israeli US bilateral cyber working group,” Thomas Bossert, assistant to the US President Donald Trump for Homeland Security and Counter-terrorism said at the Cyber Week 2017 conference in Tel Aviv Monday.\n\nThe group will strive to defend critical infrastructure against attackers and to track down perpetrators. It will be led by Rob Joyce, the US White House cybersecurity coordinator, and Israel’s Eviatar Matania, director general of the National Cyber Directorate. It will include US and Israeli representatives from various ministries and defense organizations including foreign affairs and justice, and the secret service.\n\nGet The Start-Up Israel's Daily Start-Up by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nThe team will convene this week, Bossert said.\n\n“The meetings this week will focus on a range of cyber issues — critical infrastructure, advanced R&D, international cooperation, and workforce,” Bossert said, adding that these will be the first steps in strengthening bilateral ties in cyber issues.\n\nThe agencies will be… “focused on finding and stopping cyber adversaries before they enter networks, before they reach critical infrastructure and identifying ways to hold bad actors accountable,” Bossert said. “We believe the agility Israel has in developing solutions will resolve in innovative cyber defenses that we can test here and take back to America.”\n\nBossert said that increased cyber defense and deterrence are critical today, in a world in which the cyber threat from nations is growing, and an international consensus needs to be built regarding what is “responsible state behavior.” International norms must be set out and implemented, he said. And those who do not comply with these norms should be punished.\n\n“It is time to consider different approaches,” he said, and the US is seeking to set up bilateral agreements with other partners globally who hold the same values. “There should be consequences for destruction,” he said.\n\nThe cyber sphere “is one of the biggest strategic challenges since 9/11,” he said, “because while physical borders are important, cyberspace knows no boundaries.”\n\n“Nations have the ability to steal sensitive information and data and destroy systems and the trend is heading in the wrong direction,” Bossert said. Destructive attacks are being executed by belligerent nations – North Korea attacked Sony and Iran attacked Saudi Arabia in cyber attacks – and “neither of theses countries have near the sophistication and resources of China and Russia.”\n\nIt was the kind of technology evident in the Iron Dome missile defense system, Bossert said, that the world needs as the threat moves from missiles to malware.\n\nBossert said he was at the conference to talk about cybersecurity, but he was also there to say that “President Trump understands that the United States cannot lessen our engagement in this region… and cannot lessen our support for Israel.”\n\nWhen Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced his objection to “appeasing Iran” and enabling its nuclear aspirations, he did so at “great professional risk and took political criticism for stating an unpopular truth,” Bossert said. “He was right, he was courageous, the American people agree with him and now he is a partner with President Trump and the Israeli people have a stronger and deeper relationship with the US.”\n\nAt the conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli technology and its cybersecurity leadership are opening doors to the world, breaking down hostilities and the Arab boycott.\n\n“Once it was a disadvantage to say you are from Israel,” Netanyahu said. “Today when you talk about cyber or advanced technologies, it is an advantage. It is advantage to say I am an Israeli company.”\n\n“There used to be a thing called the Arab boycott; that’s dissipating, for many, many reasons: strategic, and the prominence of Israel in the technological field,” he said.\n\nIsrael’s National Cyber Defense Authortity helps its members, who are from government and business organizations, to communicate in a secure way with each other to “not only to respond to attacks but to prevent them,” he said.\n\nEvery month Israel experiences dozens of cyber attacks at a national level, and at “every given moment, including right now, there are probably three to five attacks on a national level that emanate from various sources,” he said.\n\nCooperation between nations is important, Netanyahu said, “because we are better together,” and Israel has become an “attractive target” for cybersecurity investment, garnering about 20 percent of global private cybersecurity investment in 2016.Israel and the US are set to collaborate", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_376", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " to China and Mexico (a strong concern of Donald Trump), jobs being outsourced to low-wage countries or moved to tax havens (so-called “tax inversions” are a Hillary Clinton bugaboo), or jobs eliminated because of Obamacare or high minimum wages (a favorite Ted Cruz line).\n\nYou won’t hear many of the points below, however, either because they are too positive, too subtle to capture in a sound bite, or too long-term to worry about now. But if you want the truth about American jobs, you may want to keep reading rather than tuning into a presidential debate or stump speech.\n\nTimes Are Good\n\nIt’s hardly a bad time for jobs overall—official unemployment is at the lowest rate since 2008, and applications for unemployment insurance were at the lowest level since 1973. You won’t hear that from the Republican candidates, of course—the news is much too sanguine. If there’s a problem, it is with low labor force participation, which has dropped several percentage points over the last decade. As testimony before a Joint Economic Committee suggests, there are a variety of reasons for this, although an aging population is clearly part of the issue.\n\nThe Lack of Middle Class Jobs\n\nGrowing inequality is another big issue—the hallmark of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, and an issue that is occasionally even mentioned by Republican candidates. An overall lack of jobs is less of a problem for our economy, however, than the shortage of well-paying, middle class jobs.\n\nMany of the new jobs in the US over the last decade or two have been low-end service jobs—feeding, selling to, and taking care of our fellow Americans. These jobs don’t generally produce a lot of revenue or grow much in productivity, so it’s difficult for businesses to pay high wages to workers who perform them. And that situation isn’t going to change much no matter who is president. As a New York Times article points out, our economy is a service economy, and it’s been going in that direction for several decades now.\n\nFree Trade Isn’t the Problem\n\nThere is little doubt that some of our well-paying manufacturing jobs have gone to places like Mexico and China. But recent trade deals aren’t the problem, capitalism is. For several centuries now, manufacturing has moved to places where it’s done most cheaply and effectively. And for most industries, that place hasn’t been the U.S. for a while.\n\nDonald Trump’s bluster notwithstanding, it seems highly unlikely that any president could change this much. As a society we don’t generally like to tell businesspeople where they can produce stuff, and we don’t like paying high tariffs for stuff made elsewhere. Corporate moves to low-tax countries do some damage to our tax base, but they don’t tend to involve many jobs.\n\nAutomation Is Good\n\nIronically, our best hope for bringing manufacturing jobs home is automation. Also ironically, the same is true for outsourced service jobs. Since the U.S. is one of the world’s leaders in automation technologies, we’ve got some chance of bringing jobs home if we have the best automation capabilities and the people who are best at working with automation technologies.\n\nIn factories, this means technologists who can install, maintain, and optimize robots, CAD/CAM, and flexible manufacturing cells. In services, it means working with tools like robotic process automation and cognitive technologies that can do work previously outsourced to low-wage countries. Whether in factories or offices, all those automation machines need people to configure, install, and tend them. Because most of the actual work is done by machines, there won’t be huge numbers of jobs that will come home this way, but there will be some.\n\nInformation Technology is a Drag\n\nInformation technology hasn’t eliminated a lot of jobs, but it is keeping some from growing. Take bank tellers, for example. Contrary to what President Obama said in a 2014 interview, automated teller machines haven’t led to many fewer jobs in that field. Mr. Obama may not run into them when he needs cash, but the number of bank tellers in the U.S. has remained pretty constant since 1980, when ATMs really took off. Of course, the U.S. has grown a lot in population since 1980, but the number of tellers hasn’t. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of tellers will decline about 8% over the next decade—not a precipitous decline, but certainly not a growth occupation either.\n\nThe Service Sector Slowdown\n\nIn the future, many lower-level service jobs are going to stop growing—if not decline—because of technology. There are already some pretty capable technologies that automate truck and taxi", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_386", "config_id": 7, "prompt": ",” always knew they would obtain a medical marijuana card if their daughter needed one, she says. When oncologists diagnosed the 7-year-old with an aggressive form of cancer known as T-cell leukemia earlier this summer, Purchase and Krenzler drove Mykayla to The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation clinic in Southeast Portland and got her enrolled in the state program.\n\nPurchase and Krenzler tell The Daily Beast they aren’t the least bit embarrassed or ashamed of their actions. They’re convinced the cannabis oil their daughter now ingests in two pills each day not only has mitigated the effects of her chemotherapy but also perhaps knocked her leukemia into remission. But they made sure those early visits to the clinic where Mykayla gets her medicine were “discreet,” through a side entrance, they say. They did not tell the girl’s biological father, who they say has been out of touch for most of the child’s life. They kept it quiet, to themselves.\n\nNow they’re famous. And they’re being attacked, they say, by people who don’t understand the power of marijuana as medicine, who call them lousy parents, who’ve seized on the comment Jesse Comstock, the girl’s biological father, made in that first newspaper article—that he visited in August and found his daughter “stoned out of her mind.”\n\nComstock couldn’t be reached for comment for this story, but he’s not the only one nonplussed that each month little Mykayla consumes the distilled equivalent of a pound of marijuana, which remains classified by the federal government as a Schedule 1 narcotic, right up there with LSD and heroin. Purchase and Krenzler say the oncologist who was treating Mykayla “blew up on us” when she found out about the cannabis use and that the doctor-patient relationship became so strained they asked for a new provider. (Neither the girl’s new oncologist nor her previous doctor returned phone calls from The Daily Beast.) The couple—he a handyman in between “technical” jobs, she a hemp jewelry maker—also say they’ve received vile emails from people declaring them not just unfit parents but also deserving of jail time.\n\n“I hope they never have to be who I am,” Purchase says. “I hope they never have to feel what I’m having to feel, what she’s having to feel. I’m not drugging my child. I use this for her medicine. It’s amazing, and I think people should know that.”\n\nBut the two have discovered something else about being in the national spotlight: an overwhelming show of support, from all over the country. The number of “likes” on Mykayla’s Facebook page has tripled in the past few weeks, to 5,000. A call for donations to help the couple replace their broken-down car hit $2,000 last week, only a few days after the “Fairy Godparent Car Rally” began.\n\nOne of Mykayla’s roommates also gives her $1 every time she muscles down a shot of “cannabis juice,” a liquid derived from the plant that has no intoxicating effects—because it isn’t heated—but is unpalatable. Mykayla says she’s saving those dollars for a “Build-A-Bear” she’s making for her 17-month-old sister, Ryleigh.\n\nThose who support Mykayla’s cannabis use do so either because they’ve long believed in the plant’s healing powers or because they’re hip to mounting medical evidence that shows marijuana’s “cannabinoids” don’t just help with generalized pain, nausea, and diminished appetite but have been shown to slow cancer growth, inhibiting the formation of new blood cells that feed tumors. Some of Purchase and Krenzler’s critics are upset that they don’t treat the girl exclusively with cannabis, he says, but the couple isn’t willing to go that far.\n\nThe trouble is, there’s also research that shows marijuana use can have negative effects, especially among those who begin using the drug before they turn 18. “Persistent cannabis use” among young people was associated with “neuropsychological decline,” a Duke University survey of more than 1,000 individuals at various ages found.\n\nPurchase and Krenzler are unbowed, though. They say their daughter is not addicted to cannabis and that she’ll only use it as long it’s necessary, as long as she’s undergoing chem", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}
{"id": "sample_7_387", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Thirty-two years ago this month an explosive eruption reshaped Mount Saint Helens in a matter of seconds. An earthquake under the volcano in Washington State on May 18, 1980, triggered the largest landslide in recorded history as billions of cubic meters of mountainside tumbled away, initiating a massive release of gas, lava and ash. The cataclysm killed 57 people and sent a plume some 20 kilometers into the sky.\n\nThe 1980 eruption was not totally unexpected. For the two months prior, earthquakes and steam explosions had rattled the mountain, and the north slope of the volcano had noticeably swelled outward. But interpreting just what was happening beneath the mountain to cause those shudders and belches was not possible.\n\nNow a team in England and Germany has linked the seismic record from that era to magmatic processes beneath Mount Saint Helens by closely examining crystallized minerals formed in the volcano's innards just before eruption.\n\nIn a study appearing in the May 25 issue of Science, the researchers report that crystals of the silicate mineral orthopyroxene from 1980 and from subsequent eruptions trace various injections of magma, as well as other chemical changes, within the bowels of the volcano.\n\nThe crystals contain concentric rings of differing chemical composition. Some orthopyroxene crystals, for instance, have a magnesium-rich core surrounded by an iron-rich rim; others have an iron-rich core and a magnesium-rich rim. Each type of crystal zonation can record the conditions of the magma reservoir from which it emerged.\n\n\"We chemically fingerprint each of those zones to determine how they formed,\" says lead study author Kate Saunders, a volcanologist of the University of Bristol in England. The outer rim of an orthopyroxene crystal, she says, represents the most recent stage of crystal formation and typically grew just months before the crystal’s emergence in volcanic ejecta. That allowed the researchers to make precise estimates of when, and how, the crystals acquired their chemical forms. \"Mount Saint Helens is really good—because the samples, we know exactly when they erupted,\" Saunders says.\n\nIn several cases, a flurry of crystallization matched up well with internal activity at the volcano, as inferred from seismic records. For instance, crystals with iron-rich rims increased in number in the weeks and months leading up to the May 1980 eruption, as earthquakes shook the mountain with low-frequency seismic waves. Such long-period quakes, Saunders says, are characteristic of magma giving off gas. \"Previously it's been reported that iron-rich rims on orthopyroxene are due to changes in the water content of the magma, so it makes sense that if we've got degassing or fluxion of water or CO2 through the system, we may get more iron-rich rims,\" she says. Other crystals with magnesium-rich rims seem to mark an influx of hot magma from deep reservoirs just before eruption.\n\nThose events are also captured in the seismic record, but the root cause of the tremors is not always clear from seismology alone. That is where the crystals can provide important corroboration—or critical insight into ancient eruptions, for which seismic records do not exist. In the case of Mount Saint Helens, the study's authors \"are providing fairly convincing arguments that the periods of enhanced seismicity are related to inputs of magma,\" says Timothy Druitt, a volcanologist at Blaise Pascal University in Clermont–Ferrand, France. \"Just because you've got seismicity doesn't mean you've got magma intruding at depth,\" he adds. \"They're providing evidence that that's probably what happened. If you can establish that, then that helps you better interpret your seismicity.”\n\nEven though crystals from volcanic ejecta can only offer a window into past eruptive behavior, researchers hope that studying such minerals will provide a clearer picture of volcanic behavior overall. \"We can't get at the rocks until after they've erupted, but the more we know about a volcano and how it behaves, the better we can anticipate future eruptions,\" Saunders says. \"We can see inside, we can see what's happened in the past and, hopefully, predict what's going to happen in the future.\"Thirty-two years ago this month an explosive eruption reshaped Mount Saint Helens in a matter of seconds.

However, it was scheduled to reopen Aug. 1, 2016.\n\nAt that time, Mayor Frank Jackson chose to ban buses in favor of a unified Public Square. Jackson has said he would reopen the square to bus traffic if there were no way to keep it closed without harming RTA's operations or bottom line, and if RTA addresses the city's safety concerns.\n\nRTA is on the clock from the FTA to either reopen Superior Avenue through the square to buses or to repay $12 million in federal grants it received for the the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project.\n\nBecause the city will not permit buses to cross Public Square, RTA is not upholding its end of the funding deal it made for the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project, the FTA asserts. The Euclid Corridor Transportation Project established the HealthLine, which runs down Euclid Avenue and ends in Public Square.\n\nJackson has said RTA has not been acting in good faith about Public Square and, ultimately, has slowed down the process of reopening the square.CLEVELAND, Ohio - The federal government is giving the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority two final weeks to reopen Public Square to buses.\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration will give RTA until March 7 to allow buses on Superior Avenue through the square before it will enforce a $12-million fee.\n\nIn a Feb. 17 letter to RTA CEO Joe Calabrese, Robert Tuccillo, associate administrator for budget and policy for the FTA, writes, \"The FTA will grant a final extension of 14 days, to March 7, 2017, for GCRTA to provide a written response to FTA's Dec. 20, 2016 debt letter, or the debt will be considered delinquent and trigger debt collection actions.

{"id": "sample_7_398", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " During the 1930s Liverpool 's form continued to deteriorate , and they avoided relegation in the 1933 – 34 season by only four points . Scott left the club at the end of what had been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper . In ten matches from the start of 1934 , Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal , and after a 9 – 2 defeat against Newcastle United , he was replaced by Arthur Riley . The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form , with a 6 – 2 victory over Birmingham City and a 4 – 1 win against Middlesbrough . Scott , who joined Belfast Celtic after 24 years at Liverpool , remains the club 's longest @-@ serving player . As they became used to finishing in the lower part of the league table , Liverpool began to lose their best players . Hodgson , who had scored 233 goals in 358 league games , was sold to Aston Villa in 1936 and the club struggled to replace him . They finished 19th in the season following his departure .

Coach Adrian Heath said three of his players were on \"standby\" in consideration for selection: midfielders Ibson and Kevin Molino as well as forward Christian Ramirez.\n\n\"I'm not sure it's as by as much voting as people think,\" Heath said of the All-Star roster, which is comprised of fan vote choices and picks from All-Star and Chicago Fire coach Veljko Paunovic and league commissioner Don Garber. \"Obviously, it would have been nice to have had some representative. But as I say, I'm not sure there's been too many better players than Ibson this year. In fact, I guarantee you there hasn't been.\"\n\nAt least the Loons won't be missing any key pieces heading into a 7 p.m. Saturday matchup with defending MLS champions the Seattle Sounders FC. (Except Heath wasn't too impressed with his team's intensity level at training Tuesday at the National Sports Center.)\n\nMidfielder Rasmus Schuller (thigh), defender Marc Burch (groin), defender Thomas de Villardi (Achilles) and Ramirez (hamstring) all trained separately. Ramirez is \"day-to-day,\" according to Heath. Midfielder Sam Cronin was also absent, away on \"league business,\" but will return Wednesday.\n\nDefender Joe Greenspan returned to practice after recovering from a concussion. He had surgery on his broken nose and is wearing a mask, a la Bobby Shuttleworth.\n\nThe team also had three new college players in training with the squad: Rafael Andrade Santos, a senior midfielder from VCU; Ricky Lopez-Espin, a senior forward from Creighton and also a Shattuck St. Mary's product under United academy director Tim Carter, and Elvir Ibisevic, a sophomore forward from Nebraska-Omaha.\n\nAlso, Molino made the league's Team of the Week on Monday for his two-assist performance in a 4-0 victory against D.C. United on Saturday. Right-back Jerome Thiesson was an honorable mention on the bench.\n\nAnd as far as a transfer window update, Heath said there has been a lot of phone calls going around the league.\n\n\"The problem you have at this time is, nearly everybody wants your best players. Like we want somebody else's best player,\" Heath said. \"But sometimes if people are bringing somebody in from outside ... then that sometimes opens up people that you might think normally might not be available.\"\n\nHeath mentioned moves from one or two bigger clubs, like the Los Angeles Galaxy signing Jonathan dos Santos, and if those will make one or two other players more attainable.\n\nBut it looks like the Loons might not be after a goalkeeper before the end of the transfer window on Aug. 9. With the team declining to extend John Alvbage's loan, United has just Shuttleworth and Patrick McLain on the roster.\n\n\"We'll probably stay as we are at this moment in time,\" Heath said. \"But we'll look at the situation over the next few months.\"Major League Soccer's All-Star Game against Real Madrid is Wednesday, but no Minnesota United players made the trip to Chicago.\n\nThe Loons were one of nine MLS teams left without an All-Star rep.

{"id": "sample_7_406", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " a city long abandoned by manufacturers. He had no bike-making experience, wasn’t a serious cyclist and had left a vibrant hometown, Calgary, for a place that would become America’s largest city to file for bankruptcy.\n\nBut as an entrepreneur, Pashak was used to taking risks. Today, his company, Detroit Bikes, is a growing business and part of a lively entrepreneurial scene crucial to the revival of Detroit. The scene includes tech startups, investors, artisans, foodies, shop owners and transplants like Pashak, drawn to Detroit’s mix of grit and opportunity. Detroit Bikes appears this week on Microsoft’s #DoMore page on Instagram and kicks off a series about entrepreneurship in the Motor City.\n\n“It’s a great city to start something in,” says Pashak, a music entrepreneur before he launched Detroit Bikes. “There’s a real culture of encouraging each other and teamwork, almost. And there’s a lot of really talented people.”\n\nEntrepreneurs key to Detroit’s resurgence\n\nOnce the automotive center of the world, Detroit has become one of the most distressed cities in America, a decline triggered by lost jobs and hastened by the mortgage crisis. By the time it filed for bankruptcy in 2013, the city had shriveled to its smallest population since the 1910 census. Detroit emerged from bankruptcy last year and is on a long road of tackling crime, poverty and thousands of vacant lots and unlit streets.\n\nEntrepreneurs play a key part in Detroit’s recovery, with businesses and investments revitalizing its downtown. Detroit’s business district used to be a lackluster space with empty buildings, but now bustles with office workers, a thriving tech community and a busy streetscape of retail and residents.\n\n“The entrepreneurial scene in Detroit is amazing. It’s off the charts. You’ve got these incredible, passionate people who are pouring their heart and souls into the city,” says Josh Linkner, a founder of Detroit Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that funds early-stage tech startups in Detroit. Linkner recently stepped down as CEO of Detroit Venture Partners to focus on his career as a book author and keynote speaker.\n\nDetroit’s woes have made it cheaper for entrepreneurs to start up, while fueling an underdog mindset and desire to help the city. That collective pride shows up in slogans like “Detroit hustles harder” and “Detroit vs. Everybody.”\n\n“There is this Detroit grit, like we’ve been kicked down. We’re like the Rocky Balboa of cities; we’re fighting for life and glory,” says Linkner.\n\n“I think that is in contrast to Silicon Valley – I don’t want to be disparaging anybody – but we look at them and say, ‘Oh, they’re sipping their Frappuccinos. They just got their Stanford degree. Isn’t that nice.’ And we’re like streetfighters. I’m exaggerating, obviously, but that’s the vibe here. We have this real gritty, scrappy, resilient tenacity.”\n\nMuch of Detroit’s resurgence can be traced to one man, Quicken Loans founder and chairman Dan Gilbert, who also founded Detroit Venture Partners. Gilbert’s real estate company has invested $1.6 billion in downtown Detroit. His companies have filled the area with 12,500 employees in less than five years. More than 70 tech companies exist in a single square block, many backed by Detroit Venture Partners. Gilbert’s business presence has sparked a surge of people living, shopping and dining downtown.\n\nGabe Karp, a partner with Detroit Venture Partners, often asks young people in interviews why they want to be in Detroit, when previous generations would have passed. Their answer relays a new buzz, a passion to be the first chapter in a comeback story of a once great city.\n\n“They say, ‘We’re hearing about what’s going on, and it sounds really exciting… We want to be there on the ground floor, help write that chapter and be part of that story,’” Karp says.\n\nDetroit Bikes renews manufacturing in the city\n\nCount Detroit Bikes as part of the story. Founder and president Pashak had launched two Canadian music venues and a music festival when he decided to join Detroit’s community of problem solvers. He started Detroit Bikes in 2011, with a mission to renew manufacturing in the city.\n\nLast year, his 50,000-square-foot factory in Detroit made about a thousand bikes. He calls them the “Honda Civics of bikes,” to distinguish them from specialty and", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

{"id": "sample_7_409", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "Enlarge By Jacquelyn Martin, AP By cutting back on spending, the post office had a net operating income of $2.7B in '08, but still ended up in the red because of a costly health benefit fund for retirees. WASHINGTON (AP)  The Postal Service ended its fiscal year $2.8 billion in the red, battered by a faltering economy that cut the amount of mail being sent. Postmaster General John Potter said the agency is making sharp cuts in hours and overtime, but added there are no plans for layoffs. The mail being sent dropped by 9.5 billion items. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: Year opens with $237.2B record deficit \"We expect the new fiscal year to be another difficult one,\" Potter said, adding: \"We're not panicking here.\" By cutting back on spending the post office had a net operating income of $2.7 billion in 2008, but still ended up in the red because of the requirement for a $5.6 billion payment to a health benefit fund for retirees. Even so, the $2.8 billion loss was well short of last year's $5.1 billion postal deficit. The Postal Service does not receive a tax subsidy for its operations Potter welcomed recent reductions in the cost of fuel — a major expense for the post office — and said his agency is continuing to cut overtime and working hours as it seeks to increase efficiency. He said the agency reduced working hours by 50 million in 2008 and hopes to double that to 100 million hours cut this year. \"We are working hard to do everything that we possibly can to avoid layoffs,\" Potter added in an interview following the board meeting. The post office has been offering early retirement, which has been accepted by 3,685 workers. Asked about the possibility of cuts in service, Potter was emphatic in saying no: \"When you're in tough economic times, the last thing you want to do is back away from your customers.\" The cost of First Class postage went up to 42 cents in May and Potter said the annual increases for letters will continue to occur in May, with the new price being announced 90 days in advance. The increase is based on the rate of inflation. For packages, however, rates will increase in January so the post office will be in step with its major competitors, which generally announce new rates in January, he said. Planned rate increases are Express Mail, 5.7%; Priority Mail, 3.9%; parcel select, 5.9%; parcel return service, 5.3% and international shipping, 8.5%. Potter said the agency plans to ask Congress to restructure the way it handles payments for retiree health care. A 2006 law requires the post office to create a fund to cover retiree health care, contributing several billion dollars annually for 10 years. At the same time the agency is paying about $2 billion annually for retiree health care. The postmaster general said the agency would like to start funding retiree health care from the new account, which it will continue to build up. But it would like to eliminate the need to pay the extra $2 billion for current costs. Standard mail, mostly advertising and the largest mail category at 99.1 billion items, was down 4.3% in 2008. First class mail dropped 4.8% to 91.7 billion cards and letters and periodicals fell 2.2% to 8.6 billion. Overall, the post office had revenue of $74.9 billion, operating expenses of $72.1 billion and a health benefit fund payment of $5.6 billion for a net loss of $2.8 billion. The fiscal year began Oct. 1. \"This has been a very challenging year for the Postal Service,\" chief financial officer H. Glen Walker told the agency's governing board on Thursday.

{"id": "sample_7_419", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " this post we want to talk to you not only Startup CEOs, but everyone that makes decisions. Yes, this is about decision making. Not about how to make harder, better, faster, stronger decisions, but about how to make more thoughtful decisions. What makes a decision good, is a matter of perspective. Something may be good for the CEO, bad for the employees, neutral for the company. Some decision may be good for the company, but sucks for everyone that works there, including the CEO (i.e. binge coding into infinity fuelled by pizza and energy drinks). Also, with thoughtful decisions comes the issue of the weight of your word. Words matter, especially when said by people regarding things that effect other people. It is blatantly obvious why it is said that respect is earned and not bought. Highly respected people are usually people that think before speaking and deciding, and do not go back on their words easily. Finally, with respect, comes integrity. If you want to make it in the business world, respect and integrity matter as much as talent and skill.\n\nEvery day in life we make decisions. We decide to wake up, to brush our teeth, to put on clothes, to wear shoes, and to kick an annoying accessory dog on our way to work (or not). There’s a trend to take the concept of decision fatigue to the extreme, where you try to limit decision making stuff in your life, (i.e. wearing the same clothes every day, like Mark Zuckerberg), but ignore that for now. Every decision you make, says something about you, and it means something, to someone. That is why, before making decisions you must think about them and what they mean. Deciding to wear pajamas to work means something, but deciding to wear a slutty dress to work also means something. Kicking a dog can mean that you love football. It can also mean that you particularly don’t like dogs. It can also mean both. Decisions have a multitude of meanings to different people and just thinking about them can help you find the better one. A more realistic example is deciding that your employees have to stay late, for the fourth time this week, because the company has to meet a deadline, when you are well aware that two of your employees have children at home waiting for them. Does that decision make the boss man a dick? Maybe. Or is it something necessary, that will make or break the company, therefore making him a savior? If you think about decisions and what they mean, they can lead you to making better decisions. Here’s another example: deciding whether to use Slack, HipChat, or Microsoft Teams. Using Slack means that you/your company is cool. It also means that you like jumping on bandwagons. It’s all kinds of things.\n\nWhatever you decide, just remember to think about it beforehand. Try to balance the amount of thought in a decision relative to its importance. I.e. don’t take forever to decide what you want for lunch, because by then, it’s dinner time and people have already starved. After that’s done, you open up a drawer in your desk, grab a small hammer and a chisel, and start writing what you’ve said in a beautiful granite stone. Then, if you ever decide to change your mind, you open up your other drawer, take your stone sander out, sand the surface where you chiseled something, and then start chiseling again. This analogy should serve you when it comes to going back on your word. Imagine chiseling your big decisions and promises in very large letters in stone, whereas your small ones in miniscule letters. When it comes to going back on that decision, is it worth the work that needs to go into sanding down the stone and writing on it again? Every time you sand that granite, it’s going to lose its sheen. The shininess of your granite is going to command the respect of you by others. People will know that when you say something, you’ve thought about it, and you mean it.\n\nWhy is all of this important? Why can’t we all just be like fish, have a memory of ten seconds and just do whatever we feel like doing? It’s because decisions have consequences. Words are not just words. They turn into actions, and those actions have more planned actions that await the completion of the initial actions, thereby leading to a chain of events that are beyond any human calculations. People in positions of responsibility where they lead other people in their team should always be firm in their decisions.\n\nPeople make plans, and those plans can’t consist of only rainbows and unicorns. If you’re reading this, then mere survival is not your biggest obstacle. You’re seeking to create something bigger and better with other fellow human beings for those of tomorrow.

{"id": "sample_7_422", "config_id": 7, "prompt": "CAMBRIDGE Mass. (Reuters) - Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said he was “disappointed” at Serbian officials’ comments following a drone stunt at a soccer match this week but vowed on Thursday to push ahead with plans to meet his counterpart in Belgrade next week.\n\nPrime Minister of Albania Edi Rama is interviewed by Reuters at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts October 16, 2014. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nRelations between the two countries have been tense since a Tuesday incident in which a drone bearing a flag representing “Greater Albania,” an area covering all parts of the Balkans where ethnic Albanians live, flew over a major soccer match between the Albanian and Serbian teams, prompting a brawl on the field and the cancellation of the game.\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic earlier on Thursday claimed the incident showed that Albania was “not mature enough” to join the European community.\n\n“We feel really sad and we feel really disappointed about what happened and about how Serbian authorities are reacting. It’s unbelievable,” Rama said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nBut he said he would not allow the remarks, or claims by Serbian officials that his brother had been responsible for the drone, to derail his plans to visit the Serbian capital on Oct. 22, in what would be the first visit to that city by an Albanian leader in almost 70 years.\n\n“We should not be driven by this kind of politics of the past and hatred of the past. We should not be driven by what happened at a soccer game,” Rama said ahead of a speech at Harvard University, just outside Boston. “I am very determined to go ahead.”\n\nThe Albanian team fled the field at Tuesday’s match, held in the run-up to the Euro 2016 championships. Riot police were called in to disperse the crowd.\n\nRama noted that, in an effort to avoid any violent outbursts, Albania had sent no fans to the game other than a contingent of 45 dignitaries including his brother. The group was searched carefully by Serbian authorities, he added.\n\n“I don’t see how someone could have brought in a drone or a flag when even scarves with Albanian symbols were not allowed to enter the stadium,” Rama said. “It’s clear that the flying object came from out of the stadium.”\n\nHe also asked why media accounts to the game played down the crowd shouting threats to kill Albanians, using an ethnic slur.\n\nBoth Serbia and Albania aim one day to join the European Union. Relations between the two have long been marked by tensions over Serbia’s former province of Kosovo, which has an ethnic-Albanian majority and declared independence in 2008.\n\n“We are not going to respond in the same old way of a region that has suffered so much from this old way, from a region that has finally found peace,” Rama said. “We are in peace not because we became angels but because we are all convinced that Europe is our destination and we want to be part of the European family of nations as members of the European Union.”CAMBRIDGE Mass.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nRelations between the two countries have been tense since a Tuesday incident in which a drone bearing a flag representing “Greater Albania,” an area covering all parts of the Balkans where ethnic Albanians live, flew over a major soccer match between the Albanian and Serbian teams, prompting a brawl on the field and the cancellation of the game.\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic earlier on Thursday claimed the incident showed that Albania was “not mature enough” to join the European community.\n\n“We feel really sad and we feel really disappointed about what happened and about how Serbian authorities are reacting. It’s unbelievable,” Rama said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nBut he said he would not allow the remarks, or claims by Serbian officials that his brother had been responsible for the drone, to derail his plans to visit the Serbian capital on Oct. 22, in what would be the first visit to that city by an Albanian leader in almost 70 years.\n\n“We should not be driven by this kind of politics of the past and hatred of the past.

{"id": "sample_7_431", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " a former Florida governor who lost to Trump in the early primaries.\n\nA whole host of influential Republicans have decided not to attend July's Republican National Convention in Cleveland. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat about the diverse constellation of stars oft-promoted by the GOP in the six years since they swept into office, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.)? You won’t see them speaking in Cleveland, either.\n\n“The fact that the party elders aren’t willing to come make his case says a lot about the state of the Republican Party,” said Bill Burton, a Democratic strategist. “To the extent that Trump is having trouble getting speakers who can tell his story and tell the story he wants to tell about Hillary Clinton — it’s a larger lift.”\n\nRussell Schriefer, a longtime Republican strategist who helped run the party’s 2012 convention, said, “You don’t hear of any major Democratic figures saying they’re staying home because Hillary Clinton’s the nominee. That is the case with Trump.”\n\nBut Schriefer said the absence of more established luminaries presents “an opportunity for Republicans for stars to be born at the convention.” He noted that Barack Obama’s breakout turn came at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, when he was an Illinois state senator.\n\nFor months now, Trump has promised that his convention would be unlike any other — a dazzling, spectacular affair that soars above traditional political theater. In an April interview with The Washington Post, he said the Tampa gathering four years ago was “the single most boring convention I’ve ever seen.” He vowed to bring a “showbiz” quality to Cleveland.\n\n“It’s very important to put some showbiz into a convention, otherwise people are going to fall asleep,” he said.\n\n[While the GOP worries about convention chaos, Trump pushes for ‘showbiz’ feel]\n\nTrump has teased various plans for Cleveland, such as a “winner’s night” starring sports heroes and cultural icons of decades past. But he and his campaign team have been tight-lipped about a lineup.\n\nA list of speakers still had not been released as of Wednesday afternoon — a full week since Trump promised to do so — suggesting a last-minute scramble to book speakers. Republican operatives have complained privately this week that likely speakers have not been given final word on when they will address the delegates or what themes the Trump team would like them to discuss in their remarks. Such late uncertainty is unusual, as political conventions tend to be tightly scripted and highly choreographed.\n\nMembers of the Republican National Committee, which puts on the convention and is meeting in Cleveland this week, said they have been kept in the dark about the convention program.\n\n“Donald Trump’s run an unconventional campaign from the get-go, and he said right from the outset he wanted an unconventional program with not the usual speakers,” said Steve Duprey, an RNC member from New Hampshire. “Frankly, it might stir up more interest than parading out past luminaries of a party. Maybe the Trump way will work.”\n\nThe celebrities planning to be in Cleveland next week include Caitlyn Jenner, a former Olympian, reality television star and transgender advocate, and musical acts Kid Rock, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rascal Flatts and Big & Rich.\n\nThe Democrats traditionally draw more A-list celebrities, and this year will be no different. Among the actors and recording artists planning to attend are Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg, Fergie, Lenny Kravitz, Idina Menzel and Bryan Cranston.\n\nIn Cleveland, Republicans who have been supportive of Trump will get top billing. They include Sen. Joni Ernst (Iowa), who burst onto the scene in 2014 with a playful campaign ad vowing to apply her hog-castration skills in Washington to “make ’em squeal.” Trump eyed her as a possible vice-presidential running mate, and they met on July 4, although she later took herself out of consideration.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (Ark.), who also joined the Senate last year, plans to speak as well. Cotton is among a handful of young Republicans considered likely future presidential candidates. Another is Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), although he is a vocal Trump critic and will not be in Cleveland. Instead, Sasse plans to “take his kids to watch some dumpster fires across the state,” his spokesman provocatively told reporters.\n\nAt least two of Trump’s primary opponents — Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker — are planning to address delegates", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

She also said there is a shortage of housing appropriate for families.\n\nIn an interview with the Presse Canadienne, she said a number of tenants are living in substandard situations, over their budgets, away from their loved ones or without community services.\n\n“The housing crisis has transformed. The extreme shortage is over, but the major problem is now high housing costs,” Laflamme said.\n\nAccording to data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 270,000 tenants are facing essential housing needs in the province. Not including the homeless or those who spend the majority of their income on rent, Laflamme estimates 81,000 Quebeckers lack the funds to move and feed themselves.\n\n“Unfortunately, these statistics don’t incite a reaction,” she said. “It should be a shock.”\n\nFRAPRU estimates the 3,000 social housing units to be constructed in Quebec in the next year will not be enough to address previous budget cuts.\n\n“The Quebec government said they want to do better. We know they have a record (budgetary) surplus) but, unfortunately, in terms of politics and social programs, there’s nothing new — not a cent more,” she said.\n\nLast year, the United Nations reported a shortage of social housing in Canada, while FRAPRU says waiting lists for low-income housing are stagnant, as only 11 per cent of the rental market in Quebec is non-profit.\n\n“People who invest in housing are there to make profits,” Laflamme said. “Without rent control in Quebec, they’ll continue to increase rent significantly while incomes won’t follow.”\n\nOttawa will present its national housing strategy this fall, while the Quebec minister responsible for housing, Martin Coiteux, will complete his revision of the AccèsLogis program.\n\nFRAPRU argues for the formal recognition of the right to housing — not in having a roof over one’s head, but “a place where one can live safely, in peace and with dignity.”\n\nIn 2016, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Quebec was $751, according to the CMHC, compared with $808 in Quebec City and $791 in Montreal.The housing crisis, which was meant to subside four years ago according to statistics, is still continuing, says a housing rights group.\n\nThe Front d’action populaire en réaménagement urbain (FRAPRU) used moving season that culminated on Saturday to reiterate their demands for social housing.\n\nVéronique Laflamme, a spokesperson for the organization, said dozens of families didn’t find themselves on the streets on July 1, as was the case in the early 2000s.\n\nNevertheless, she said the crisis has not abated as salaries aren’t increasing at the same rate as rent prices.\n\nLast year in Quebec, the vacancy rate stayed at 4.4 per cent — a number that should reflect stability in the rental market.\n\nLaflamme argues vacancy rates have decreased at an alarming rate in certain neighbourhoods like St-Leonard and Ahuntsic-Cartierville.

That's because although legalization of marijuana is sweeping the nation, sales of the plant-based drug will continue to be sold on the black market for some time.\n\n\"There are conservative states that are not putting this on the ballot in the near future,\" said Scott Greiper, founder and president of Viridian Capital & Research. \"They are far away from legalizing despite the allure of revenues of marijuana sales.\"\n\nSome $10 to $15 billion is expected to comprise legal sales in the next three to five years.\n\n\"States that are currently legalizing are slow rolling it in order to regulate the use and ensure a chain of custody, compliance and tracking,\" Greiper told MainStreet. The Viridian Cannabis Industry Report and Stock Index revealed that publicly traded marijuana stocks increased 848% in the first quarter of 2014 when Colorado legalized recreational use, but the sector has since dropped, ending the first nine months of 2014 with a 147% gain.\n\n\"We see a shake-out coming as lofty valuations come down to reality, questionable operators are forced from the industry and the real winners in the sector become apparent,\" Greiper said. \"This will accelerate the movement of more traditional capital sources into cannabis stocks.\"\n\nAbout 60 marijuana related companies have gone public since 2012 when only 13 were listed on the exchange compared to 70 currently listed on the pink sheets.\n\n\"There's a lot of disbelief in the prospect of the management capability of public companies,\" said Michael Swartz, analyst with Viridian Capital & Research. \"To bridge the gap and bring credibility, we've issued this research report that landscapes the industry so that institutional investors have an understanding of how marijuana companies are being valued to access the capital markets.\"\n\nThe top performing sectors of the Viridian Cannabis Stock Index include consulting services with returns of 665.5%, biotech at 339% and 135% for infused products.\n\n\"With broker, banker and analyst licenses with the SEC and FINRA, we transact all of our investment banking transactions through Pickwick Capital Partners, which allows us to act as an investment banker to these public companies,\" said Greiper.\n\nLeading publicly traded consulting companies include Medbox (MDBX) and United Cannabis Corp. (CNAB).\n\n\"Entrepreneurs wanting to launch a marijuana business need consulting services to apply for a license and once they get a license, they need help identifying real estate buildings that are compliant with zoning requirements and state regulation,\" Swartz told MainStreet.\n\nThe highest performing biotech publicly traded marijuana companies include Abattis (ATTBF) and Cannabix Pharmaceutical (CNBX).\n\n\"There are biotech companies and scientists who are creating formulations of different strains of cannabis that are relevant to medical marijuana patients that investors find interesting,\" said Swartz.\n\nAmong the top performing infused products and extracts companies are Cannabis Sativa (CBDS) and Green Cures and Botanicals (GRCU).\n\n\"We expect that as more recreational states open up, this sector will grow more,\" Swartz said. \"In Colorado, we're seeing a lot of tourism. People are coming from out of town to try legal marijuana but they don't want to smoke. They use vaporizers, edibles or candy and there's a lot of demand for that.\"\n\nAlthough Viridian itself doesn't invest principally, the company engages with smaller private equity firms, sector focused funds, hedge funds and family offices.\n\n\"They are our base of investors that we have been raising money from to invest in marijuana publicly traded companies,\" said Greiper.\n\n--Written by Juliette Fairley for MainStreetNEW YORK (MainStreet) - The amount of pot purchased annually by Americans is an estimated $50 billion, but and only $2 to $2.5 billion of it is purchased legally, according to a Wall Street report.

{"id": "sample_7_454", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " for installation instructions, there’s no documentation yet, there is however a simple wiki application in the examples directory.\n\nAlthough MongoDB does not enforce any schema, it seemed like a useful thing to define a simple entity language anyway, if not for the database itself, for me, as documentation and possibly for automatic form generation and data validation, later. This is what it looks like:\n\n(defent Page\n\n[:title :string {:unique true}]\n\n[:author :string]\n\n[:text :text])\n\nAs can be guessed, this defines a Page entity with three properties: title, author and text.\n\nAs you will be aware, I’m a developer of WebDSL, a DSL for building web applications, and came to appreciate its simple page and template abstractions. Although implementing actions in a WebDSL fashion would be against the functional character of the language, I did add a page abstraction, except I call them webfns, defined with defwebfn (similar to defn, to define a Clojure function):\n\n(defwebfn say-hello [nam str]\n\n(str “Hello, “ nam))\n\nThis defines a web function with one parameter: nam, which is coerced to a string value through the str function. Similarly, every entity definition also defines a function with the same name that can coerce the URL representation (identifier) and retrieve its value from the database, e.g.:\n\n(Page “31108a33ee093a4bdd7b5900”)\n\nRetrieves the page object with ID “31108a33ee093a4bdd7b5900”. This can be taken advantage of in web functions as follows:\n\n(defwebfn show-title [p Page]\n\n(str “Title: “ (:title p)))\n\nThese webfns are available through a URI based on their name and the last part of the namespace they were defined in. For instance, when a webfn show is defined in namespace myapp.user, it will be available through “/user/show”. Any namespace ending with .index, or webfn named index, are bound to the root, e.g. webfn index in myapp.user results in “/user” and webfn index in myapp.index is bound to “/”.\n\nTemplates are, of course, simply functions with parameters. Compojure comes with a rather nice alternative HTML representation using Clojure vectors:\n\n[:a {:href “/”} “Link text”]\n\nWhich can be used to define a main template:\n\n(defn main-layout [title & body]\n\n(html\n\n(doctype :html4)\n\n[:html\n\n[:head\n\n[:title title]]\n\n[:body\n\n[:h1 “Header”]\n\n[:hr]\n\nbody\n\n[:hr]\n\n“© Zef Hemel”]]))\n\nOf course, vectors like these can easily be combined with regular function calls, to build pages. Here is an example of an index page with title “Wiki home”, displaying a list of current pages and a form to add a new one:\n\n(defwebfn index []\n\n(main-layout\n\n“Wiki home”\n\n[:h1 “All wiki pages”]\n\n[:ul\n\n(for [p (query model/Page)]\n\n[:li (navigate [show p] (:title p))])]\n\n(form [handle-add]\n\n[:h1 “Add a page”]\n\n[:div “Title: “ (input-string :title)]\n\n[:div (input-text :text)]\n\n(submit-button “Add page”))))\n\nThis will be rendered roughly as follows:\n\nThe actual adding happens in the handle-add function:\n\n(defwebfn handle-add []\n\n(let [p (databind\n\n(model/Page\n\n:author (get-session :username))\n\n*form* [:title :text])]\n\n(redirect [show (persist! p)])))\n\nAdditionally, I can define an access control rule for handle-add:\n\n(defac handle-add (get-session :username))\n\nWhich says that only if the session key :username has a value, i.e. the user is logged in, a page can be added, resulting in the handle-add only to be available to logged in", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

types of steel products from China\n\nDuties are up to 53 per cent of the export price, and are intended to help Arrium\n\nAustralian Workers Union says the move will not help Whyalla\n\nIndustry Minister Christopher Pyne said duties of between 37 per cent and 53 per cent of the export price would apply to \"rod in coil\", and between 11 per cent and 30 per cent on reinforcing bar.\n\nThe move is intended to drive down oversupply of Chinese steel, and is based on recommendations by the Anti-Dumping Commission.\n\nPressure has been mounting on the Government to tighten anti-dumping measures as a result of the plight of Arrium.\n\nThe company is in voluntary administration with debts of $4 billion, and workers at the company's Whyalla steelworks are facing an uncertain future.\n\n\"Obviously we have relatively high production costs and China has relatively low production costs, and they have been potentially unfairly pricing their steel in Australia because of extra support from their Government,\" Mr Pyne said.\n\n\"This obviously assists Arrium who are producers of these kinds of goods.\n\n\"The Australian Government is working to sustain the local steel industry, while acting within World Trade Organisation rules.\"\n\nMr Pyne said the duties would apply as of April 22.\n\nThe Government said the exact duty would depend on the exporter, and \"there would be an additional duty should the export price fall below a specified floor price\".\n\nThe Australian Workers Union (AWU) said the measures would help parts of Arrium's business but did not go far enough.\n\n\"It's certainly not the fix for Whyalla,\" national secretary Scott McDine said.\n\n\"We need to boost local steel procurement for Government infrastructure projects up to 90 per cent... and we need to see co-investment in steelworks like Whyalla so we can upgrade them.\"\n\nSouth Australian acting branch secretary Peter Lamps said Whyalla was mainly in the business of producing steel products other than those targeted by the new measures.\n\n\"Whyalla mainly produces structural steel and rail products,\" he said.\n\n\"That is just as much under stress, as far as the dumping of overseas products is concerned, as reo rod and bar.\"\n\nSA Government offers free legal advice to Whyalla contractors\n\nThe Federal Government said Australia currently has 44 anti-dumping measures in place that apply to 12 steel products from 14 countries.\n\nThe union said the new duties do not breach Australia's obligations under its free trade agreement with China.\n\nSouth Australian Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis visited Whyalla on Friday to meet with contractors receiving free legal advice from the State Government.\n\nDebts to Arrium's suppliers have been frozen and it is not clear when they will be paid.\n\n\"We're also offering accounting services and consultation with the administrator to make sure they all get access to the appropriate financial advice,\" Mr Koutsantonis said.\n\nMr Koutsantonis said a 10-month high in iron ore prices would do little to help Arrium in the short term.\n\nTopics: steel, industry, federal-government, unions,

He has a great awareness, his knowledge of the game, his preparation is off the charts. He does an outstanding job. And then you go back and look at that very first third-down conversion: He goes, runs a good route, breaks a tackle.\n\n\"And that's what we’ve always been talking about as far as breaking tackles creates a big-play opportunity.

And so what we're going to need to have is a conversation about, How do you reconcile a federal law that still says marijuana is a federal offense and state laws that say that it's legal?\"\n\nIn a statement Monday, U.S. Attorney John Walsh said that the Department of Justice is \"reviewing\" the initiatives passed in both states and that the department's \"responsibility to enforce the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged.\"\n\n\"Regardless of any changes in state law, including the change that will go into effect on December 10 in Colorado, growing, selling or possessing any amount of marijuana remains illegal under federal law,\" Walsh said.\n\nThe Justice Department is familiar with negotiating contradictory state and federal laws on marijuana. Aside from the two states which have legalized recreational use of marijuana, 18 states and the District of Columbia have allowed legal use of the drug for medical reasons.\n\nMarijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug by the Drug Enforcement Agency, meaning it's dangerous and has no medical use.

Last year, law enforcement agents seized 3.9 million plants in the Golden State and were poised to collect more this year.\n\nMarijuana advocates say the attack collides with California's law and goes against a campaign promise by Obama to not circumvent the state's relaxed rules.\n\nA USA Today/Gallup poll conducted after November's election indicated 64% of Americans felt the federal government should not take steps to enforce federal anti-marijuana laws in states where it has been made legal for recreational use.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll conducted between November 28 and December 3 showed 51% of registered voters nationwide thought marijuana should be made legal in the United States, compared to 44% who thought it should remain illegal.\n\nCNNMoney's Jose Paliery contributed to this report.6 years ago\n\nWashington (CNN) – President Barack Obama says that federal law enforcement agencies have \"bigger fish to fry\" than prosecuting marijuana users in Colorado and Washington, which voted in November to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.\n\nObama made explicit in an interview to air Friday on ABC News that prosecution of marijuana users in the two states would be placed low on his Justice Department's list of law enforcement priorities, but that certain issues must still be ironed out as more states could pass similar legislation.\n\n\"This is a tough problem, because Congress has not yet changed the law,\" Obama said. \"I head up the executive branch; we're supposed to be carrying out laws.

Im Gespräch sind 3,5 Millionen Euro – das ist der Eintracht allerdings offenbar zu wenig. Denkbar, dass S04 also noch ein bisschen drauflegen muss für den Kolasinac-Ersatz. Allerdings dürfte Sportvorstand Christian Heidel auch nicht gewillt sein, einen zu hohen Preis zu bezahlen, denn: Der 28 Jahre alte Oczipka hat nur noch ein Jahr Vertrag bei den Hessen und wäre im nächsten Sommer gegebenenfalls für lau zu haben.\n\nDie Anfang der Woche bekannt gewordenen Abwerbeversuche aus dem Ruhrgebiet haben bei Eintracht-Trainer Niko Kovac für Empörung gesorgt. Denn er schätzt die Qualitäten Oczipkas sehr – auf und neben dem Platz. Der in Bergisch Gladbach geborene Profi hat sich seit 2012 in 146 Bundesligaspielen für Frankfurt (zwei Tore, 22 Vorlagen) als konstant und extrem zuverlässig erwiesen. Er fiel nicht als Lautsprecher auf, wohl aber als wichtiges integratives Element innerhalb der Mannschaft. Noch vor zwei Wochen hat sich Eintracht-Sportvorstand Fredi Bobic zuversichtlich gezeigt, das 2018 auslaufende Arbeitspapier zu verlängern.06.07.2017\n\nSchalke\n\nMit Oczipka einig – jetzt geht’s um die Ablöse\n\nFoto: firo\n\nEr gehörte zu den wenigen positiven Erscheinungen in einer ansonsten sehr mäßigen Schalker Saison:\n\nUmso schmerzlicher wird man in Gelsenkirchen Sead Kolasinac in der bevorstehenden Spielzeit vermissen.

{"id": "sample_7_474", "config_id": 7, "prompt": " Exotic ransomware appears to be currently in development mode, with three variants released over the past three days, According to MalwareHunterTeam, the first variant contained an image of Hitler as part of the background to the ransom note, the second included a different picture of Hitler and some text, and the third contains the Jigsaw-like screenlocker shown in the video above.\n\nHitler Background from Version 2\n\nIn general, there is nothing particularly innovative about this ransomware, other than it targets executables as well. This causes not only your data to be encrypted, but your programs to be unusable as well.\n\nExotic targets Executable Files\n\nMost ransomware infections only target data files and leave the executables alone. With Exotic, when it encrypts a particular folder it will also encrypt the executables in these folders, which makes the programs unusable.\n\nThankfully, most programs are properly stored in folders that are not targeted by Exotic. On the other hand, if you had downloaded files and stored them under the %UserProfile% folder, such as the Downloads folder, then these files will now be encrypted as well.\n\nThe Exotic Ransomware Encryption Process\n\nThanks to MalwareHunterTeam, I was able to get a copy of the source code for the Exotic Ransomware to see exactly how it works. When the ransomware starts it will scan certain folders for files that have specific extensions. When it encounters a targeted file extension, it will encrypt the file using AES-128 encryption, rename the file, and append the .exotic extension to them. For example, a file called test.jpg could be encrypted as the file name 87as.exotic.\n\nEncrypted Files\n\nAs previously mentioned, when Exotic encrypts a computer it is currently only targeting specific folders. These folders are:\n\n%UserProfile%\\Desktop %UserProfile%\\MyMusic %UserProfile%\\Personal %UserProfile%\\MyVideos %UserProfile%\\Contacts\\ %UserProfile%\\Downloads\\ %UserProfile%\\MyPictures /vmware-host/ %UserProfile%\n\nThe file types that Exotic will encrypt are:\n\n.txt .exe .text .cur .contact .ani .xls .com .url .ppt .src .cmd .tgz .fon .pl .lib .load .CompositeFont .png .exe .mp3 .mkv .veg .mp4 .lnk .zip .rar .7z .jpg .sln .crdownload .msi .vb .vbs .vbt .config .settings .resx .vbproj .json .jpeg .scss .css .html .hta .ttc .ttf .eot .camproj .m4r .001 .002 .003 .004 .005 .006 .007 .008 .009 .au .aex .8be .8bf .8bi .abr .adf .apk .ai .asd .bin .bat .gif .3dm .3g2 .exe .3gp .aaf .accdb .aep .aepx .aet .ai .aif .arw .as .as3 .asf .asp .asx .avi .bay .bmp .cdr .cer .class .cpp .contact .cr2 .crt .crw .cs .csv .dll .db .dbf .dcr .der .dng .doc .docb .docm .docx .dot .dotm .dotx .dwg .dxf .dxg .efx .eps .erf .fla .flv .iso .idml .iff .ini .sik .indb .indd .indl .indt .ico .inx .jar .jnt .jnt .java .key .kdc .m3u .m3u8 .m4u .max .mdb .mdf .mef .mid .mov .mpa .mpeg .mpg .mrw .msg .nef .nrw .odb .odc .odm .odp .ods .odt .orf .p12 .p7b .p7c .pdb .pdf .pef .pem .pfx .php .plb .pmd .pot .potm .potx .ppam .ppj .pps .ppsm .ppsx .ppt .pptm .pptx .prel .prproj .ps .psd .pst .ptx .r3d .ra .raf .raw .rb .rtf .rw2 .rwl .sdf .sldm .sldx .sql .sr2 .srf .srw .svg .swf .", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

I would have to do a solo retreat of one hundred days in winter, most of the time with no source of heat, in complete silence other than occasional instruction from him, and with no meal after noon.\n\nWith all that had happened, I felt that I was now ready for such an ordeal. My training began on December 22, the day of the winter solstice. The abbot had warned me that part of the old-fashioned way involved certain ascetic practices derived not from Buddhism, but from the shamanic tradition of Shinto, Japan’s pre-Buddhist tribal religion. One of the most common methods that tribal cultures use to obtain visions of gods or spirits is through prolonged exposure to extreme hot or cold. In India, Hindus have the “five fires” practice; in North America, Native Americans have the sweat lodge and the sun dance. These involve heat. The traditional Shinto shamanic practice goes in the other direction. It involves cold — squatting under freezing waterfalls in winter, or standing in cold springs, or dousing your body with ice water, and so forth.\n\nBecause Shingon is Vajrayana, the main meditation practice involves working with visualizations, mantras, and mudra gestures. You replace your self-image with that of an archetype, you replace your usual mental talk with the mantra of that archetype, and you take on the physical and emotional body experience of that archetype through making mudras — ritual hand gestures. If your concentration is good enough, your identity briefly shifts. You become that archetype. This gives you insight into the arbitrary nature of self-identity. The technical term for this practice is deity yoga because you experience merging (yoga, i.e., “yoking”) with a mythic archetype.\n\nMy current way of teaching mindfulness is, in part, informed by this early Shingon training. I have people observe self in terms of inner mental images, mental talk, and emotional body sensation, the three sensory elements used in the Vajrayana deity yoga practice. I’ve created a hybrid approach. What I have people observe is derived from the Japanese Vajrayana paradigm: self = mental image + mental talk + body. But how I have people observe is derived from mindfulness, which has its origin in Southeast Asian Theravada practice. So, in a sense, I have brought the abbot’s lineage back, although probably not quite in the form that he was expecting.\n\nThe visualizations, mantras, and mudras are woven together into the framework of a ritual invocation. The traditional basic training (known as kegyo) involves doing three such invocations daily, with the abbot privately initiating you into how to do the ceremonies. The Shinto shamanic piece comes prior to each of the three ritual invocations, when the practitioner is required to do cold-water purification. You have to go to a cistern filled with half-frozen water, break the ice on top, fill a huge wooden bucket, and then squat and dump the bonechilling liquid over your naked body. It’s so cold that the water freezes the moment it touches the floor, and your towel freezes in your hand, so you are sliding around barefoot on ice, trying to dry your body with a frozen hand towel.\n\nFor me, this cold-water purification was a horrific ordeal. Maybe being a thin-skinned Californian had something to do with it. I did notice, however, that if I stayed in a state of high concentration while I did it, my distress was noticeably lessened. On the other hand, as soon as my attention wandered, the suffering became unbearable.\n\nFor me, this cold-water purification was a horrific ordeal. Maybe being a thin-skinned Californian had something to do with it. I did notice, however, that if I stayed in a state of high concentration while I did it, my distress was noticeably lessened. On the other hand, as soon as my attention wandered, the suffering became unbearable. I could see that this whole training situation was a giant biofeedback device designed to keep a person in some degree of samadhi at all times.\n\nOn the third day of this training, as I was about to pour the water over myself, I had an epiphany. It hit me with crystal clarity. I was faced with a trichotomy; the future forked into three branches. I could spend the next ninety-seven days in a state of high concentration all my waking hours, spend them in abject misery, or give up and fail to complete my commitment. The choice was obvious.\n\nWhen I completed the hundred-day training, it was the spring of a new year, and I had a new self. I had entered the crucible (or should I say cryostat?) of the traditional Shingon training and had come out a different person.

I wanted to fight on that card so bad. Looks like it wasn’t meant to be and it’s not going to happen. I’m going to get my [right] knee fixed and get back to training as soon as I can. I’m sorry to the fans in Mexico who were expecting this fight, and I hope to be able to come down and still be a part of this historic event.”\n\nFor Werdum, it was never about Cain, it was always about the title.\n\n“I’m ready for whatever comes. I have been training in Mexico for nearly two months and accept the challenge that is presented to me. I'll continue to prepare and will arrive ready to fight on behalf of all my Latin American fans,\" said Werdum.\n\nMark Hunt, never one to shy away from a big opportunity, wasted no time accepting a dream opportunity to fight for UFC gold.\n\n“I feel blessed to have this opportunity to fight for another world title. This is something that doesn’t happen often to people. First K1 and now UFC – how can I say no, even though it’s on short notice? I’m dropping everything and flying to Mexico tomorrow so I can best prepare myself for this fight. I have to get into shape and acclimatize to that environment, which is really important.\n\n“There’s nothing to lose when you’re competing against the best at the top level,” Hunt added.\n\nUFC 180: WERDUM vs. HUNT scheduled for November 15 at the Arena Mexico City, sold-out in only eight hours, and will welcome more than 20,000 fans. Along with the explosive main event, fans will also be treated to six other bouts featuring Latin American contenders.\n\nFor more information visit www.ufcnetwork.com.

Labor mobility. We did a shallow investigation of the cause of labor mobility that included a conversation with Michael Clemens, a researcher on the global economics of migration who has been a leading voice on the humanitarian benefits of labor mobility.. However, it wasn’t until we communicated an intent to fund labor-mobility-related work that Dr. Clemens approached us with giving opportunities, including support of his own work as well as another project that we will be writing about in the future. We find the project both promising and unlikely to get funded without our involvement, and believe that we wouldn’t have been able to find out about it without specifically communicating an intent to provide funding.

New top charities. We have also been interested in making grants to increase the supply of evidence-backed charities serving the global poor. Here too, we have started conversations with research organizations that we wouldn’t have been able to have without a strong interest in (and high likelihood of) providing funding.\n\nWhy expressing stronger interest can lead to better giving opportunities\n\nPeople are often hesitant to ask for funding, or even mention that they’re seeking it, until and unless they perceive a strong specific interest on the part of the person they’re talking to. (Just knowing that the person they’re talking to is a funder and “open to many possibilities” is often not enough.) Part of this may be a fear of being perceived as “unsuccessful” if they are public about having an idea that they can’t find funding for.\n\nPeople are often hesitant to put time into fleshing out an idea until they see a potential path to getting it funded. This seems rational, especially since different funders will often have different preferences in terms of what information they find most important, what sorts of proposals they want to see, and what aspects of the work are most important to prioritize from their perspective.\n\nMany people seem to seek funding primarily by going through their networks, and seeking out people who are clearly interested in what they’re doing (rather than by publicly disseminating their ideas).\n\nWithout pretending to know exactly how the dynamics work, it seems to us that:\n\nIn theory, it seems possible to have a world in which funding ideas are written up and posted publicly for anyone to browse. In reality, funding ideas are often not even internally fleshed out (much less written up) until specific interest is perceived. Because of this, asking someone for giving opportunities often means asking for substantial amounts of their time and energy, and it can be inappropriate to do so except when one has a high probability of following through with funding.\n\nThe approach we’re taking\n\nBe very thoughtful and careful about how we spend our time, and realize that making grants will almost always have implications for how we spend our time (by signaling our interests, by causing more people doing similar work to approach us, by forming relationships with grantees, etc.)\n\nWhen we’re interested in an area, be willing to express strong interest in providing funding and to follow through with high probability.\n\nFund projects we come across that seem reasonable, that we’re willing to spend some time following up on, and that fit within our interests in terms of what areas we want to learn more about and see more proposals from.\n\nOur basic heuristics for deciding what and how much to fund has been:\n\nOur priority at the moment is asking what sorts of giving opportunities might exist in different causes (and, along with this, learning about meta-", "prompt_length": 1024, "generation_length": 64, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 1024}}

Their ranks grew as they marched west on University Avenue, blocking both sides of the street and shouting expletives about Donald Trump in English and Spanish.\n\nThe group, which peaked at about 300 people, circled back downtown and, at 10:35 p.m., were at St. Anthony Avenue and Marion Street, St. Paul police said. Officers were there directing traffic, but not interfering with the protest. There was no violence, police said.\n\nThe protest was one of several in U.S. cities in the wake of Tuesday’s election of the GOP candidate, notably in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and Portland, Ore.\n\n“This is about what’s going to be done in our name,” said Peter Rachleff, a former Macalester College professor. “We’re all responsible. We’re better than this.”\n\nBobbie Scott said, “I’m here because I feel I have to be here. Other work will come later, but for now, I’m here.”\n\nGallery: Trump protest at the Minnesota Capitol Gallery: Trump protest at the Minnesota Capitol\n\nCallia Blake, 17, and her 15-year-old friend aren’t old enough to vote yet, but came out to protest Trump’s ascension, too. “This guy, he’s a rapist, he just is awful,” she said. “I can’t take that; I can’t do it.”\n\nJoAnn Hendricks, 67, was there with her friend, LaVonne Ellington, 80, who served as a poll watcher on Tuesday. “LaVonne and I didn’t vote for Trump. I’m not a ‘Trumpladite,’ ” Hendricks said. “That’s why we’re here. We didn’t know what else to do. I’m really sad.”\n\nEarlier, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, some students had a shouting match over the election.\n\nStudents were struggling to digest the results of one of the most bitter presidential elections in memory.\n\n“I guess it’s really setting in right now,” said Sam Wondimu, 20, a U health services major who was one of dozens of students gathered around a single laptop at the Black Student Union, watching as President Obama spoke about Trump’s election. “There’s a considerable amount of sadness,” Wondimu said, and “I guess a bit of fear.”\n\nMoments later, a clash broke out between a black student and a white student wearing a Trump “Make America Great Again” hat just outside the black student group’s headquarters at Coffman Memorial Union.\n\nMatthew Selmen, 19, said he was doing his homework when another man noticed his hat and started yelling at him, accusing him of being a racist. Selmen videotaped the incident, saying the man threatened him before leaving.\n\n“I think it really comes down to ignorance on behalf of both sides,” he said, insisting that students were jumping to conclusions because he was a Trump supporter. “I don’t support everything he says or does,” he said, but “if we can’t have a conversation here, I don’t think that’s right.”\n\nOthers, though, wondered if Selmen meant to be provocative. “This is the second floor of Coffman, this is where multicultural students come,” said Keren Habtes, a journalism and history major. “So you come here with that hat? It seemed like it was very divisive.”\n\nAt Macalester, President Brian Rosenberg sent a campuswide e-mail Wednesday, noting that many on the St. Paul campus are feeling “grief, fear, anger [and] bewilderment” in the wake of the election and encouraging anyone “overwhelmed by these feelings” to seek help from the counseling center or other campus services.\n\nIn La Crosse, Wis., meanwhile, Chancellor Joe Gow of the University of Wisconsin denounced what he called a hate crime after someone scrawled the words “go home” followed by a racist epithet on an off-campus student residence. “No members of the [university] community should ever have to experience this kind of hate and intimidation,” he wrote in a campus e-mail.
