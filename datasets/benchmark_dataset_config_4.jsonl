And the last step is to clamp the two pieces of the extension on the magazine and reinstall the two Allen screws.\n\nAlthough the Glock 43 loses its compactness with this 43-10 extension, the advantage is obviously to have a spare magazine with this extension installed. The larger magazine would be no problem to carry separately and to conceal effectively. So you can carry the small gun and have a larger capacity magazine for a reload. It also doesn’t interfere with the holster. So you can use the same holster with the extended magazine in the gun.\n\nHere are a couple of videos about the 43-10 and its installation process:\n\nRight now the 43-10 extension is available only in black color, but more color options will be offered later.

They’ve got us here; we might as well be on that racetrack putting on a show for the fans.\n\nQ: At the start of this year, exactly 2,900 drivers had ever raced in the Sprint Cup Series. Where do you rank among those 2,900?\n\nA: Damn! I have no idea. The stats — you could quickly look that up and figure it out. It’s hard to judge that over the years, because if I could run three times a week like they did (in NASCAR’s early days), I think you could improve your results. Everybody always tries to judge racing as you see it today to racing as you saw it back then, and it’s just simply not matchable.\n\nThey had one car they raced; we have a fleet of cars that are built differently for different tracks. They had five employees; we have 500 employees. You know what I mean? It’s so different. It’s hard to judge where a guy like Dale Earnhardt ranks, let alone yourself.\n\nQ: What do you think your reputation is, and is that reputation accurate?\n\nA: (Laughs) Probably pretty accurate! I think everybody knows that I like having fun. The biggest thing is, people can be misled into thinking I’m not being serious. When I’m competing, I’m dead serious and I want to beat these guys. That’s something that’s misunderstood about me sometimes.

If you want to go study computers in the city, you can do that.

The only way to do that is to broaden the tent.\n\n\"Not only does [the work of the CTTC] make sense at a policy level or an investment level, it makes sense at an individual level. Like with Nilda and her family: they are preserving the natural environment as well as finding ways to create products from their environment for their livelihoods. They can send their kids to school, they can support their families.\"\n\nLater this year, world leaders will gather in Paris for the next COP to find solutions for dealing with climate change. They will come by airplane and limousine, and they will fill the finest hotels. While they negotiate and debate, in a \"cloud kingdom\" across the world, a group of weavers, led by one woman, will be doing what their ancestors did for centuries, weaving stories of sustainability and solution, using the astonishing biodiversity of the region responsibly and with great success. As Callañaupa says, \"It is becoming clear that the survival of diversity contributes to the valuable storehouse of world resources.\"\n\n\"Artisans are often the stewards of the natural world,\" says Clark. \"Often in traditional ways ... they are working in their communities with products that are from their environment, be it fibers from leaves, bark from trees, or natural dyes from difference sources. So they are invested in ensuring that those resources will always be there.\"\n\nIn the introduction to one of Callañaupa's books, Weaving in the Peruvian Highlands, anthropologist, ethnobotanist, author, and photographer Wade Davis writes: \"These textiles are sacred cloth, woven from the threads of memory by Andean hands that are at last firmly in control of their destiny. Each tells a story, and each story is a prayer for the well-being of the people, the land, and the community.\"\n\nCallañaupa's work means that we can produce goods that have global value", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

We learned of this report after it was disclosed and reported to the appropriate authorities.

A recent paper in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry claims that the piperine, an ingredient in black pepper, has the power to stop the body from making new fat cells, and could be used to treat obesity.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto.com iStockphoto.com\n\nNow before you run out and buy yourself a pepper grinder and a pint of ice cream, it's worth noting that the studies were done on cells grown in a petri dish. And not even human cells — mouse cells — loaded with concentrations of piperine 100 times higher than what one might ever achieve in the bloodstream.\n\n\"That's not to say that pepper might not have some really interesting effects,\" Michael Jensen, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic, tells The Salt.\n\nTurns out there is some limited evidence that pepper, ginger- and other spicy foods might actually benefit your metabolism. There are a number of studies showing that capsaicin — the stuff that gives chili peppers their heat — can rev-up the motor of our metabolism – and some of them have even been done on humans. Even mild peppers contain it, as we've reported before.\n\nBut the effects are modest at best. At least one study suggests that the function of capsaicin may be to suppress appetite, rather than increase calorie or fat burning.\n\nStill, those modest benefits are enough to spark claims that extracts of these spices are the next weight loss miracle. Capsules of cayenne or piperine extracts can be found online or in the nutritional supplement section of your local drug store, and dozens of manufacturers include them in products that claim to promote weight loss.\n\nBut researchers at Purdue University have found some evidence that it may not be enough to just take a pill — you have to actually taste the pepper to make it effective. That same research showed that the metabolic effects are strongest in people who don't normally eat spicy food, and the effects may only be temporary.\n\nWith regard to the current study, Mike Jensen says that even if black pepper can prevent new fat cells from forming in humans the same way it prevents mouse fat cells from forming in a petri dish, that might not be such a good thing.\n\n\"I'm not poo-poo-ing pepper. It may have some beneficial effects. Just maybe not through the mechanism they are proposing,\" says Jensen.\n", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

The war on drugs has failed -- why isn't it being shut down?\n\nAs acclaimed filmmaker Eugene Jarecki's latest video shows, the war on drugs has failed in every way possible. Trying to wage the war on drugs has costs the U.S. $1 trillion, with another $51 billion adding to the tally each year. This has resulted in 45 million drug related arrests, with the U.S. now jailing 2.3 million prisoners -- more people than anyone else on the planet. What has all this accomplished? \"Rates of addiction remain unchanged, overdose deaths are at an all-time high and drugs cost less than ever before.\"\n\nWhile attitudes and opinions on drug reform are dramatically shifting in the U.S. and across the world, more needs to be done. I echo Eugene's call for U.S. citizens to urge Congress to advance the Smarter Sentencing Act. This could help put an end to racial profiling, mass incarceration, shattered communities and failed policy. The Smarter Sentencing Act will save the U.S. billions of dollars, which could be spent on helping people overcome drug dependencies. It will also ease dangerous overcrowding in prisons by reducing sentences for non-violent drug offenders.\n\nEvery day, more people agree the war on drugs has failed and must change. As the Global Commission on Drug Policy has highlighted, and campaigns like Breaking The Taboo have illustrated, it's time for the rest of the world to learn from the likes of Portugal and Uruguay, and the brave steps they have taken to treat drugs as a health problem.\n\nPoliticians must listen to the people who, as Global Commission on Drug Policy research has shown, want them to find a new way. When we visited Ironwood State Prison in California recently, it was clear that everyone from the prisoners to the guards, the families to the legislators, believe the way drug problems are treated has to change.\n\nIt's time to speak out. It's time to adopt and experiment with new approaches. It's time to ask governments around the world to study the evidence and look at the harm being done by outdated drug laws. Most importantly, it's time to start thinking about and treating drug problems as a health issue, not a criminal issue.If I started a business and it was clearly failing, I would shut it down.

That 18-to-20-year-olds defend our country with automatic weapons overseas does not mean that they can be trusted with handguns within our country. A similar law should bar rifle or shotgun purchases by persons who are under 18.\n\nAssault rifles must be virtually banned. These, according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, are “short, compact, selective-fire weapons that fire a cartridge intermediate in power.” For example, the Russian AK-47 or the American M-16 rifles. No civilian should be able to transfer or possess any assault rifle that was not already in circulation by 1986.\n\nAny of the older assault rifles in citizen hands should be registered with the government. If someone wants to acquire one, both the buyer and seller should have to file an application with the ATF. The tax for a transfer should be $200, to discourage ownership. In the application, the ATF should require fingerprints and two recent photographs. Local law enforcement should be notified. The FBI should conduct a background investigation, and the registration process should take months.\n\nIf the purchaser is permitted to acquire the assault rifle, she should be required to maintain records proving that the rifle is registered, and notify the government of any change in address. To take the assault rifle out of state, the owner should need written permission from ATF in advance.\n\nAssault rifles are one type of automatic firearm, but there are many other types of automatics. All of them should be controlled just as strictly as assault rifles. A violation of the stringent laws on these guns should be a felony with up to 10 years imprisonment—and much longer in cases of multiple violations.\n\nThe above is just the minimum baseline for federal laws. States should be allowed to enact must more restrictive additional laws.\n\nIf you think that this legal system would make firearms the most-regulated common consumer product in the United States, you would be correct. Every one of the above restrictions is already federal law, and has been for decades. A few of these date back to the 1980s or 1990s. Most of them are from the Gun Control Act of 1968. The tax and registration laws on automatics are from the National Firearms Act of 1934.\n\nFor decades researchers have found that many Americans do not understand how strict gun control laws already are.

It stopped over in Thailand, Myanmar, and Bangladesh, before reaching Bhutan. Upon entering Bhutanese airspace, the helicopter landed at the Gelephu domestic airport to refuel before heading to Paro airport.\n\nThe chairman of the helicopter board, Cabinet Secretary Kinzang Wangdi, was on board the helicopter. He joined the flight crew as a passenger from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The flight crew consisted of two test pilots and one engineer working for Airbus Helicopters. One of the Airbus pilots was the CEO of Airbus Helicopters.\n\nThe helicopter can accommodate up to seven passengers, excluding the pilot.\n\nThe chairman, who had never flown in a helicopter prior, said that he was initially nervous but that the flight had been “pleasant”, quiet and comfortable. He also pointed out that it was quite an experience given the panoramic view as a result of the large wrap-around windscreen and wide windows.\n\nKinzang Wangdi said it is significant that Bhutan is receiving its first helicopter and will be introducing its services on the 60th Birth Anniversary of His Majesty The Fourth Druk Gyalpo.\n\nThe government plans to use the helicopters for search and rescue, air medical evacuations, fire fighting, moving cargo, transport of VIPs and government officials, and possibly even for tourism, among others.\n\nThe helicopter will be undergoing proving flights in the next few days as required by the Bhutan Civil Aviation Authority. Flights could occur to other parts of the country.\n\nNews of the helicopter’s arrival was welcomed by citizens on social media with many offering their congratulations. Many posted and shared photos of the helicopter.\n\nThe helicopter will be based at the old hangar at Paro airport, which is the headquarters of the Royal Bhutan Helicopter Services Ltd (RBHS). The state-owned company has already recruited a pilot recommended by Airbus, and a helicopter engineer from India. Both have already started working for the company.\n\nThe second helicopter is", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It's not a lot of money but it could help,\" he said.\n\nCllr Lacey also claimed that some 18 apartments were owned by a receiver.\n\nRead More: Residents angry at new charges for fire safety work at Dockland homes\n\nThe complex was constructed by Gendson, a vehicle for bankrupt developer Bernard McNamara, which has now gone into receivership.\n\nCllr Lacey suggested that these apartments could be sold in order to help residents with the funding required.\n\n\"The figures outlined last night at the meeting - whether they can find that money at the end of the week, it's a little unreal. We need to identify where such monies will come from in a very short period of time.\"\n\nThe 299 units in the development were built eight years ago by former developer Bernard McNamara who later went bankrupt. Most were sold to private buyers and some cost more than €500,000.\n\nIn February, it emerged serious shortcomings were discovered in an inspection last summer, including some walls deemed inadequate to contain a fire and an absence of some smoke vents needed if a fire broke out.\n\nConsultations with Dublin Fire Brigade resulted in an evacuation of the blocks being avoided", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Don’t Be Tardy seems like a way easier show to do. Unless of course, the money was better. And then there’s other original RHOA cast member Sheree Whitfield. She did return last season as a part time cast member, but that was not enough for me. I need the original ladies back on my show, but is it going to happen? NeNe shared the latest with her followers on Twitter.\n\nCLICK “CONTINUE READING” FOR MORE!\n\nNeNe shut down the rumors that she was returning as a Housewife when she responded to a fan on Twitter and wrote, “I wasn’t asked 2 b a full time housewife or part time but they got Sheree & I think Kim Z.” I didn’t think that NeNe would want to be a full time cast member. She had a way better deal last season: popping in whenever she wanted, throwing some funny shade, and peacing out before she was really affected by the drama. I can see her doing something similar next season. Because, why not? She gets the best of both worlds if she takes that route!\n\nRELATED: Kroy Biermann Cut By The Buffalo Bills\n\nMy interest is also piqued by the last part of the tweet when she mentioned Sheree and Kim. I’m not at all surprised by Sheree getting the promotion to a full time cast member since she did put in that time as a recurring cast member last season. The Kim part throws me off though. Her spin off show seems to be doing pretty well and it seems way less stressful than arguing with Housewives so it’s weird that she would want to leave.\n\nAccording to Hip Hollywood, NeNe made it clear that she is happy for Kim and Sheree (if the gossip ends up being true) since she reportedly tweeted, “Never bitter! Please support them.” I could not find the tweet myself, but NeNe seems to be cool with both Sheree and Kim so I believe she wrote that.\n\nTELL US – WHICH FORMER CAST MEM", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It’s actually quite an exciting idea.”\n\nCountries using forms of e-voting include the US, Brazil, Belgium, Estonia, the Philippines and India. The term “e-voting” includes online voting where electors can cast their ballot from any computer using a secure ID.\n\nElectronic voting began in the 1960s, with the use of punched card systems. Since then, more modern systems have been introduced and include electronic machines in polling stations operated by buttons or touchscreens which connect to a central database.\n", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Without dissociation and an overbearing feeling of powerlessness many Lebanese would not have taken part in the bloodshed that lasted so many years, nor would they have sworn allegiance to leaders on the premise of momentary power in an otherwise helpless situation.\n\nYears after the end of the Civil War dissociation and powerlessness remain the dominant force at play. The powerful leaders of that war are currently the country’s Ministers and MPs thanks to an amnesty law that allows them to remain in power, widening the gap between the wealthy elite and the people. This structure has largely remained unchallenged even in the face of rampant corruption, culminated in the worst era of governmental performance yet.\n\nPoverty, pacification policies seal the deal:\n\nMaterial wealth equals power and as Lebanon’s economy continues to nosedive, so do its people become more powerless. This isn’t the case for the ruling oligarchs and their circle of elites who keep their riches out of state coffers through a ‘Wealth Defense Industry’: a cadre of professionals hired to lobby government and advise ways of hiding wealth, often through keeping it in tax havens.\n\nThe Wealth Defense Industry’s main objective is to maintain and increase the power and wealth of the elite. In turn, and as part of maintenance works, those in power implement pacification policies, and band aid to bullet wound fixes. They keep things barely running but not bad enough to ignite a revolution. The only way out of poverty comes in the form of making connections with the major game-players. To do that one has to swear allegiance and undying loyalty in exchange for a price or a job. This artificial system (which the Israeli government is widely known for using) ensures that a segment of the population is comfortable enough to suppress any potential uprising. To protect the status quo this segment would find it difficult to abandon privilege for the sake of larger national goals such as restorative justice. As a result, helplessness again prevails and feeds the dissociation mechanism.\n\nHow to break free:\n\nThe first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one. Lebanon cannot move forward without adequately dealing with its past. Anything short of that is leading us", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

I hope I can live up to the expectations of Daman Speed Academy - where I have trained - and of course Abu Dhabi Racing who have placed so much trust in me.\"If she did make it all the way to Formula 1, Qubaisi would be one of only of six women to compete at the sport's highest levels. Only two women have ever qualified to begin a Grand Prix race.Given her young age and obvious skill on the track, motorsports journalists believe there is no reason Qubaisi can't make it.She has already taken to Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina racetrack to try out her single-seater, Kaspersky Lab-sponsored racing car and hopes it will take her to victory next season.\"I've tested the car at Yas Marina Circuit and in Dubai and hope to get good results. My karting experience will help me - Formula 4 is a different strategy but I was within the pace when I tested,\" she told the UAE-based website.\"Prema are a great team who have delivered champions. Moreover, Kaspersky Lab has come on board to sponsor the first ever female Emirati driver at this level of racing, which is fantastic.\"Qubaisi will compete in 12 races around the world during the championship, including in her native UAE - where she is guaranteed to have strong support from the local crowd.Nicknamed \"The Flying Girl\", Qubaisi has the backing of her father, Khaled al-Qubaisi, who is the founder of Daman Speed Academy and managing director at Abu Dhabi Racing He has high hopes for his daughter and is confident she will progress to the most competitive grades of motorsport.\"We hope this association will go a long way in getting Amna to compete ultimately at the highest", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 511}}

East Kent Goldings and Fuggles hops are along for the ride.\n\nThe three beer drinkers among us all liked the beer, all found the ginger and sweetness components muted to an agreeable degree, and didn’t object to the strength, since we spread the beer around, thereby avoiding the antics of Trinculo, Stephano and Caliban.\n\nDeb Luskin, who’s not a big beer drinker, but a graceful writer, gave it a sip and a one-word interjectional review: “Ew!”\n\nName: Merry Maker Gingerbread Stout\n\nBrewer: Boston Beer Co., Massachusetts\n\nStyle: Spiced sweet stout\n\nABV: 9%\n\nAvailability: November, nationwide\n\nFor More Information: www.samueladams.com\n\n[December 18, 2014]\n\n<12 Beers of Christmas 6: Elysian Bifrost Winter Ale\n\n12 Beers of Christmas 4", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It was printed in an oversized, magazine-style format using black and white artwork on cheap newsprint and had a print run of only 3,275 copies. It was a period of intense speculation in comic book investment, with especially strong interest in black and white comics from independent companies. The first printings of the original TMNT comics had small print runs that made them instant collector items. Within months, the books were trading at prices over 50 times their cover price.\n\nThe success also led to a black and white comics boom in the mid-1980s,[citation needed] wherein other small publishers put out animal-based parody books hoping to make a quick profit. Among them, the Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters, the Pre-Teen Dirty-Gene Kung Fu Kangaroos, the Adult Thermonuclear Samurai Elephants, and the Karate Kreatures were obvious parodies of TMNT. Most of them were sold to comic shops in large numbers, but failed to catch on with readers. This speculation led to financial problems with both comic shops and distributors, contributing to a sales collapse in 1986–87.\n\nThe \"Return to New York\" story arc concluded in the spring of 1989 and by this time the Ninja Turtles phenomenon was well established in other media. Eastman and Laird then found themselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut, overseeing a wide array of licensing deals. This prevented the two creators from participating in the day-to-day work of writing and illustrating a monthly comic book. For this reason, many guest artists were invited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe. The breadth of diversity found in the various short stories had the adverse effect of somewhat disrupting continuity and gave the series a disjointed, anthology-like feel. Some of these artists, including Michael Dooney, Eric Talbot, A.C. Farley, Ryan Brown, Steve Lavigne, Steve Murphy, and Jim Lawson, continued to work with Mirage Studios for years to come.\n\nIssue #45 kicked off a major turning point, as Mirage made a concerted effort to return the series to continuity. A 13-part story arc entitled \"City at War\" began with issue #50, which was the first issue to be completely written and illustrated by both Eastman and Laird since issue #11. Both \"City at War,\"", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Here is Brown's full statement about Royal's passing, which is a window into the relationship between the two Texas coaches:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Today is a very sad day. I lost a wonderful friend, a mentor, a confidant and my hero. College football lost maybe its best ever and the world lost a great man. I can hardly put in words how much Coach Royal means to me and all that he has done for me and my family. I wouldn't even be at Texas without Coach. His counsel and friendship meant a lot to me before I came to Texas, but it's been my guiding light for my 15 years here. \"Coach gave so much more to the State of Texas and college football than he took away. He forgot more football than most of us will ever know, including me. His impact on the game, the coaches and players, the community and the millions of lives he touched, is insurmountable. He will be missed in so many ways. \"I lost my Dad when I was 54, and Coach filled a real void in my life and treated me like family. Sally and I gained a lot coming to Texas and being a part of this tremendous program but no more than our relationship with Coach and Edith. They were our closest of friends. Our heart pours out to Edith and the family and our thoughts and prayers are with her and the family. We will always be there to lend any and all support that we can as she and Coach always did for us.\"\n\n- - -\n\nGot a tip for Dr. Saturday? Email us at dr.saturday@ymail.com .

While a public enquiry has been established to probe Foster’s role, it has not started sittings and the first minister has refused to contemplate standing down.\n\nMost opinion polls indicate the DUP will remain the largest party, but that Sinn Fein may make gains.\n\nFoster described the March 2 vote as the province’s most important in two decades due to the possibility that Sinn Fein could become the largest party and push for Irish reunification just as Britain is negotiating its exit from the European Union.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nUnder the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement, Britain’s Secretary of State to Northern Ireland is obliged to order a referendum if it appears likely that a majority would seek to form part of a united Ireland.\n", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_4_144", "config_id": 4, "prompt": "Share\n\nWith all of the Windows 8, Xbox One, and Microsoft tablet-based news circling the Internet lately, it’s easy to forget that Microsoft also has a dedicated research sector that is always dabbling in new and innovative technologies. Today, via IEEE Spectrum, we’re getting a glimpse at one such Microsoft Research project – a robotic, moving, interactive touchscreen.\n\nNormally, these types of projects would contain intense development cycles and the introduction of new technologies. This is a rare case though, as Microsoft Research discovered it could create its desired effect by simply snapping a display onto a robotic arm (okay, so it’s a little more technical than that).\n\nThe screen is able to sense the intensity of a user’s touch and react accordingly. In the demonstration video, shown below, principal researcher of Microsoft Research, Mike Sinclair, showcases the device’s ability to create “life like” tension by pushing on some virtual blocks. Each block is made from a different substance, and they all vary in weight. Pushing on the “metal block,” in this instance, provides much more tension than pushing on the “wooden block.” The screen moves back and forth accordingly, pushing back against Sinclair’s finger in order to simulate return force. This makes for a much more interactive touchscreen experience.\n\nThe screen is also capable of virtually mimicking the shape of an object. Sinclair shows this by pushing on the rounded edges of a beach ball. Each touch causes the screen to adjust itself forward or backward, and, according to Sinclair, the effect causes the beach ball to retain a virtual surface where it actually feels as if the ball is round, even though you are aware that you are touching a plane that is completely flat.\n\nMicrosoft has no immediate plans for the discovery, although the video does showcase how doctors could use this technology to better understand MRIs and scans.

That’s why I say until we know more about how the intelligence community came to this conclusion we don’t know whether it is Russian inspired or a false flag\n\nHere's the transcript, detailing the relevant part of Bolton's interview with Eric Shawn:\n\nBolton’s comments reflected echo the skeptical attitude of the Trump team in the wake of The Washington Post’s report on the CIA’s unsettling findings about Russia’s interference during the presidential election. Trump, himself, called the CIA’s assessment “ridiculous” in a pre-taped interview that aired Sunday.\n\n“I think it’s just another excuse.

But on the other hand it doesn't matter if you think it's exciting or not; it's what's going to happen.\"\n\nI thought of Bowie and his perceptiveness last week, when – in a rare piece of corporate carelessness – Amazon inadvertently provided a fleeting glimpse of what it has in store for the publishing industry. A new page appeared on its website only to be very quickly withdrawn, but not before it had been cached by Google and spotted by a hacker website.\n\nWhat was on this elusive page? Why, nothing more or less than an introduction to a new service called \"Kindle Unlimited\". Subscribers will be invited to \"enjoy unlimited access to over 600,000 titles and thousands of audiobooks on any device for just $9.99 a month\". One commentator described it as \"Netflix for books\". David Bowie would doubtless have said that it's the turn of books to become like running water or electricity.\n\nBowie was perceptive because he understood early the implications of ubiquitous connectivity. When Apple first cracked the problem of selling music tracks online, people collected the tracks in little electronic containers called iPods and carried them around, much as tourists in undeveloped countries carried personal supplies of clean water in bottles. But once safe piped water became readily available, the importance of having one's own bottle declined. The same thing happened with online music, which is why we now have services such as Spotify into which subscribers can tap whenever they please (and have a network connection).\n\nKindle Unlimited is based on exactly the same logic. Indeed, it's extraordinary how closely it adheres to the original Apple template: the Kindle e-reader is the equivalent of the iPod; and the Kindle store is the counterpart of the iTunes one. The difference is that Amazon is already working on the next move – making the transition from selling discrete units to streaming – with which Apple has struggled (and which explains why Apple bought Beats – not for its daft headphones but for its streaming music service).\n\nAmazon's move will be as discombobulating for the book publishing industry as the advent of Spotify was for the music industry. Stand by, therefore, for howls of protest from publishers and authors on how streaming produces infinitesimal royalties compared with the old publishing paradigm.

Col. (ret) Ann Wright, who's organizing a US vessel named the Audacity of Hope for the flotilla, says her ship has been detained in Athens on spurious charges that it's not seaworthy. She says that charge was made by an Israeli legal group.\n\nNow the Juliano is held up. Mikael Löfgren, a spokesman for Ship to Gaza Sweden, says the damage was discovered at 6:30 in the evening Athens time today, and that divers probably cut the propeller in the past 24 hours.\n\n\"The reports I'm receiving is that it's certain that it was sabotage,\" says Mr. Löfgren, reached by phone in Sweden. \"The propeller and [propeller shaft] has been cut and we have divers that have filmed the damages. Experts have said there’s no doubt\" that the damage was deliberate.\n\nHe says that repairing the damage will take a few days. As to who is responsible, he declined to speculate. \"We simply don't know who did it, but it's obviously a hostile act,\" says Löfgren.\n\nIsrael has been desperate to stop the flotilla from nearing Gaza. Israel raided a similar flotilla in international waters last year, killing nine pro-Palestinian activists in the process, one of them an American citizen. In the wake of that event, and the international outcry against Israel, Israel eased some of the restrictions on the flow of goods into Gaza.\n\nThis year, Israel is determined it doesn't get that far. Earlier today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet approve using any means necessary to stop the flotilla from reaching Gaza.\n\nThe US has also been putting pressure on the activists to hold back. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton characterized the flotilla as hostile in a comment last week.\n\n\"We think that it's not helpful for there to be flotillas that try to provoke action by entering into Israeli waters and creating a situation in which the Israelis have the right to defend themselves,\" Clinton said.\n\nThe flotilla, in fact, says it has no plans to enter Israeli waters, instead planning on transiting through international waters to Gaza's territorial waters.

But taking into account how adults describe their own race as well as the racial backgrounds of their parents and grandparents – which the census does not do – Pew Research estimates that 6.9% of the U.S. adult population could be considered multiracial.\n\nFor this state analysis, we used Census data because the Pew Research survey did not have an adequate sample size for state-level analysis. (Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming were not analyzed due to the small number of multiracial people interviewed in those states.)\n\nIn Hawaii, the vast majority (70%) of multiracial residents say they are some combination of white, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. For example, the largest biracial groups in Hawaii are white and Asian (18%), Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (18%), and white and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (12%). Interestingly, Hawaii is the only state to have a tri-racial group as its largest multiracial group, one that includes white, Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (22%). There is also wide diversity within the Asian race subgroup, with people claiming roots in China, Japan and the Philippines – nations from which immigrants arrived with the growth of the sugar cane industry in the mid-1800s.\n\nHawaii’s abundance of multiracial people with Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander heritage differs from the makeup of the nation’s overall multiracial population (including adults and children). In the U.S., the multiracial population is more evenly spread among biracial white and black (22%), white and Asian (18%) and white and American Indian (16%).\n\nThere are other states that have multiracial concentrations that differ from the nation as a whole. In the western states of California and Washington, biracial white and Asian is the largest multiracial group. (California is home to the nation’s largest Hispanic population, but Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity and not a race by the Census Bureau. Hispanics are not included in the analysis of racial groups.)\n\nThe states where biracial white and American Indian is the majority of a state’s multiracial population include Oklahoma (61%) and Maine (53%).", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_4_176", "config_id": 4, "prompt": "’ pricing will be higher than corporate purveyors like Cargill, the product will be high-quality and can be custom-blended to a brewer’s specifications. Haus Malts uses a type of two-row barley called Newdale that is grown by Maine Potato Growers, Inc., in Presque Isle, Maine. It is sent by truck to Hirzel Farms in Luckey, Ohio, where the seeds are cleaned so that uniform barley kernels can be shipped to Haus Malts. The company, whose warehouse is now stocked with raw material, will soon turn its wheat, spelt, rye and barley into specific combinations of malt, called “grain bills,” that will be sold to craft brewers. Martahus compares the malting process to coffee roasting, although it’s obviously significantly more complex than that. Throughout the carefully monitored seven-day process, the grain is steeped in a temperature-controlled germination room, baked in a low-temperature kiln and then filtered through a rootlet remover called a deculmer before it’s placed in 50 pound bags. “We start the full-fledged germination process,” said the chemistry major. “During the first four days, it’s growing. The kernel has a matrix of protein and starch, and it starts producing enzymes that start to sugar. We stop before it fully sprouts through the end of the kernel. We’ve used some but not all of the starch. Then the brewer converts the starch and sugar using natural enzymes in the kernel. That makes sugar, and yeast eats the sugar to make alcohol.” Haus Malts plans to focus initially on the Cleveland area, testing its malt combinations on breweries like Great Lakes, Platform and Market Garden, which have expressed interest in the product. Martahus said that he’s already received inquiries from breweries in Columbus, Toledo and Cincinnati, among other places. The company will focus on the Great Lakes region. To gear up for opening the facility, both father and son attended a two-week intensive program at the Canadian Malting Barley Technical Centre in Winnipeg, Canada. Traveling clear across North America was pretty much the only way to learn the craft from experts at the so-called “malt academy” of Canada. “It was the only place to learn how to malt that was not through the big corporations that control the market,” said Andrew Martahus.", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Eisenberg also revealed that fans will see Lex Luthor’s backstory in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\n\n“The character has a core of reality,” Eisenberg explained. “[Luthor] has a back story that’s tragic and an emotional inner life that’s authentic. That’s in the movie. It was my interest in playing the character with a real emotional core, and this writer, Chris Terrio’s interest in creating a character that seemed viable in reality.”\n\nZack Snyder told The Los Angeles Times that he originally offered Eisenberg a different role (he wouldn’t say which), and Eisenberg declined. He then went back to Eisenberg with the Lex Luthor offer, which he obviously accepted.\n\n“I feel like once [Eisenberg] found out who Lex was he embraced it,” Snyder said. “Once you kind of start digging into Lex, it’s a bit of a scary thing to be that guy. I don’t think he just goes ‘Oh, I’ll just be that guy and then when I go home I’m not him.’ I think the thing with Jessie is he wasn’t immune to the reality of playing a super-scary character.”\n\nSOURCE: The Los Angeles TimesThe Los Angeles Times published an in-depth interview with Jesse Eisenberg about his Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice role, and it has some interesting new details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about Lex Luthor’s different hair styles in the movie, Eisenberg replied “when you see the movie, you’ll see.

Theophylline is a chemical from the Xanthine class, which also includes caffeine.\n\nSmarter Nootropics states that “When Captagon is taken, it becomes in vivo d-amphetamine and theophylline, and these two new compounds are absorbed into the blood stream, and can now cross the blood brain barrier and become centrally active.”\n\nA study however, conducted in 2005 by Alabdalla MA for Forensic Science International of 124 batches of seized captagon, revealed they contained no fenethylline at all.\n\nRather, these counterfeit captagon tablets contained amphetamine, methamphetamine, ephedrine, metronidazole, caffeine, theophylline, chlorphenamine, procaine, trimethoprim, chloroquine, and quinine. In short, a drug cocktail far more potent than the original name brand version.\n\nIndeed, reports suggest that Syrian insurgent groups ingest a far ranging and prodigious amount of potent drugs including “Baltcon”, “Afoun”,”Zolm”, Opium, Heroin, Cocaine, and Hashish.\n\nAccording to Frank Lamb in CounterPunch: “Jihadists high on drugs apparently feel invincible and hostile and do not fear death. Many are indeed ferocious and fearless fighters during the day, as many media sources have reported. But by nightfall, when the drug wears off the fighters become exhausted and sometimes they are found asleep on the spot they were fighting from.”\n\nTo read more about drugs and ISIS by Andrew Arnett click here.\n\nYou", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "pile", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_4_203", "config_id": 4, "prompt": " most hated tax.”\n\nAlthough states generally don’t levy property taxes (Arizona did until 1996, and Minnesota taxes some commercial and seasonal property), state lawmakers routinely look for ways to ease them at the local level with caps, subsidies, exemptions, or changes in the balance between commercial and residential tax rates. In addition to New York, Connecticut and Texas, relief proposals have been up for debate in Pennsylvania, Maine and Nebraska this year.\n\nIn New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo talked of how “middle- and lower-income families (are) struggling under the crushing weigh of property taxes” in January, when he announced a plan for $1.7 billion in tax credits for qualifying homeowners and renters.\n\nThe legislature removed Cuomo’s proposed credit from the state budget in March. But Cuomo has said he’s continuing to negotiate it with legislative leaders and a compromise may be possible next month.\n\nThe Connecticut Legislature is considering a bill that would provide property tax relief by giving towns more money from state sales tax revenue. The state issued a report last year showing property taxes were the largest component of taxes collected in the state, raising $9.5 billion annually compared to $5.8 billion in income taxes and $3.4 billion in sales taxes.\n\nIn New Jersey, budget constraints last year forced the state to postpone scheduled property tax discounts for elderly, disabled and low-income homeowners, but they’re included in tax bills mailed out this month. A report this year by the state League of Municipalities concluded that property taxes would have to drop 35 percent to bring them into line with comparable suburbs of New York City and Philadelphia.\n\nPennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has proposed increases in state income tax and sales taxes to help fund $3.8 billion in property tax relief next year. Lawmakers are continuing to review the proposal.\n\nMaine is considering a plan from Republican Gov. Paul LePage that would remove the property tax exemption that some nonprofits now have starting in 2019. In Nebraska, plans to relieve taxes, for farmers especially, appear dead this year and instead will be studied.\n\nIn Texas, lawmakers are still debating property tax breaks. Republican Gov.

I remember waking up Monday mornings with a pit in my stomach, always feeling anxious about the week to come. Truly, I had nothing to fear and there were never any situations during the week that I was unable to tackle, but for some reason, Monday mornings (actually, usually beginning Sunday afternoons) were a time a fear.\n\nOne of the greatest things I’ve learned is how your morning actions set the tone for the rest of your day. By putting the following steps into practice, I was able to change my daily mindset, feeling much more confident as I walked into the office Monday morning, and every day after that!\n\nThe magical tip? Set your GPS daily!\n\nWhat does this mean? Peta Kelly, a woman I respect tremendously (check her out at at Life by my Own Design…she’s brilliant), explains it like this: you are all dressed up and ready for an amazing party. You have on your sexiest outfit, a bottle of the most delicious champagne, and are ready for the night ahead. You get in your car, set your GPS to the party location, and arrive there on time, excited for the night ahead. Now imagine the opposite situation: you are all ready to go, still in your drop-dead outfit, carrying that bottle of champagne, but you get in your car and don’t set your GPS. You’ve never been to the party before, and without knowing the location of the party (or being guided by your GPS), you end up spending your night driving around in circles, never making it to the party, and missing out on all the fun.\n\nSounds like a waste of a night, right? Although this example is fairly basic, I love how simply it explains the following idea: without having an intention of where you want to go in your life, you’ll never make it there.\n\nIt takes a daily practice of connecting to your goals in order to reach the destination you are aiming for! Using Peta’s techniques, I began setting my daily GPS. Every morning as I drink my big cup of tea, I spend 10 minutes outlining my GPS and reflecting on it.

After production wraps costumes are stored in case they need re-takes or re-shooting. After the release many times costumes end up in storage. There are large warehouses filled with costumes and clothes used in movies. Important pieces are held for display and publicity, but most end up in storage. Sometimes costume departments for other movies will recycle old costumes, re-making them for a new character. When the warehouses get too full the costumes will be culled, some sent to thrift stores, some will be auctioned off, some will be sent to film museums depending on the importance of the costume and the actor who wore it. Some actors have riders in their contracts that allow them to keep a few special costumes, usually ownership belongs to the production company. Costumes are considered an asset and something that can be sold to raise money for other productions.\n\nFor television programs all costumes are kept until the show wraps up production, then they are dispersed. When productions shuts down the actors are given first dibs at their favourite props and costumes. Julia Louis Dreyfuss kept her entire Elaine wardrobe from Seinfeld; Jason Alexander kept George's glasses, sneakers, velvet clothes and the Yankees sheets and blankets. The girls from Friends kept many items and auctioned off many others as part of a fundraiser. Important pieces are held for publicity and museums (I imagine Horatio Caine's sunglasses will end up in the Smithsonian, like Seinfeld's puffy shirt) and the rest are auctioned off (important pieces again, think Sex and The City) and the rest sent to thrift stores.\n\nStage costumes are not like real clothes in the materials used and the construction. A 18th century court dress may look authentic on stage, but it can be constructed on modern fabrics with invisible zippers to allow the actor to change quickly between scenes. Stage costumes are they are kept in storage and/or recycled into new costumes. The Stratford Festival in Canada re-uses costumes, laces, trims, shoes, wigs etc. There are a few important costumes that are kept for publicity. Every few years the costume department hold a garage sale of costumes, laces, shoes, and grab bags of leftover supplies. I have been to several of these sales and know people who work in the costume shop.

{"id": "sample_4_216", "config_id": 4, "prompt": " protection of individuals—of Jews—to government. American Jews, as opposed to Jews through most of history, unilaterally cede this power even though it is available to them.\n\nThe issue is not simply Left versus Right. The Reform movement explicitly wishes to restrict or prohibit individual gun ownership. In contrast, Orthodox silence on the issue tacitly accepts both the legal status quo, which permits private guns, and social norms, under which Jews do not own guns. The denominational positions effectively converge. Guns are not for Jews.\n\nOne pathological consequence of Jewish powerlessness has been the tendency to embrace weakness, rationalizing it and the suffering it produces as elevated and noble. Another pathology is guilt regarding whatever power one does possess. For American Jews, who are not shy about wielding their social and economic power, the choice to remain unarmed is perverse—but logical.\n\nJews also follow the prejudices of their social class. Educated upper middle-class suburbanites, largely untouched by gun violence, are notably opposed to guns. Their opposition reflects intellectuals’ assumptions about the sources of and solutions to violence, and blame is assigned to the technology. True, the culture of the shooters themselves is identified as the problem in certain cases—say, neo-Nazis. But in other cases, such as inner cities, culture is quietly ignored: Highlighting it might be thought racist. Expiating a sense of privilege by restricting the rights of others is another hallmark of the educated upper middle class. In this sense, too, Jews emulate their fellows and embrace weakness.\n\nThere is also a passive-aggressive element in the American Jewish attitude: It cedes a monopoly on violence to government not just in exchange for the government’s protection but as a way of establishing an entitlement to—of demanding—such protection. Government, correspondingly, offers sympathy to victims while accepting empowerment as their protector. Unfortunately, criminals and terrorists have not agreed to the bargain. Thus, the Jewish attitude, a form of pacifism, entails the occasional human sacrifice.\n\nBut the American social contract uniquely specifies that government does not retain a monopoly on violence. The country was founded precisely in rebellion against such an idea, a rebellion that is burned into the nation’s founding documents. Moreover, the power of governments to threaten liberties is fact, not paranoid fantasy; Jews have been victims of state violence as much or more than non-state violence. The question of whether to place total trust in the state for protection does not have a self-evident answer.", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Because not even one slice remains from last week, and I didn’t manage to do any baking for this Shabbat. But if you wait until my husband arrives, perhaps he found some at the baker’s. In the meantime, if you’re hungry, I can give you sardines and plain bread.”\n\nI remained silent, saying not a word.\n\nThe hostess said, “When I was a girl, Sabbath in Father’s home boasted more guests than we now host in an entire week. And each guest would find meat and fish and all types of tasty treats. Afterwards father would pay them for having allowed him to perform the mitzvah of welcoming guests. And now his daughter receives payment from her guests for each and every slice of bread they eat under her roof. A person moves to the Land of Israel to increase his mitzvot, and in the end he cannot keep even those mitzvot he would have fulfilled in Exile. I saw you looking at my tin candlesticks. Those aren’t the same candlesticks I brought from my father’s home. Those were made of silver but were sold off the first year we arrived here in the Land of Israel. The ones I lit tonight were purchased from a woman who returned abroad last year. In the meantime what did I use as candlesticks? Don’t ask, my friend, don’t ask. If my heart didn’t break from embarrassment, the earthenware candlesticks I used at that time broke on account of my anguish. Now, thank God, we live like most of those in the Land of Israel—neither with comfort and wealth, nor with paucity and poverty.”\n\nI forgot my hunger and listened to the words of the innkeeper’s wife, who spoke with me and with herself.\n\nShe went on, “We don’t live in riches and honor, but you can understand from what I’m saying that I do not seek riches and honor.

If you’ve just hired an SEO Agency, or if you’re embarking on your own SEO adventure, then you’ll want to get to grips with link building early in the game. This will not only help you to understand what is required, but also what you can expect.\n\nThere are many ways you can build links to your site, starting with:\n\nNatural Links – these happen when you create content which other website owners and bloggers want to link to. These can happen without any effort, other than the effort required to create share-worthy content. Some argue that these are the best and most valuable types of links, as they demonstrate that you produce trust-worthy content. Examples:\n\nStart a company blog which provides valuable industry information.\n\nMake your content, images for example, available under the creative commons licence, requesting a link-back when used.\n\nManual Links -Your SEO agency may spend time submitting your website and content to other websites in an effort to get your content linked. This is when SEO starts to get time consuming. How can you make this easier?\n\nMake it mutual; offer to link to another site in exchange for them linking to yours.\n\nOffer partnership links between your regular business customers, or offer your customers a ‘valued customer’ style logo for their blog. If your customers are willing to show their support for you by liking you on Facebook, they may well be happy to include you on their website or blog.\n\nPost on industry forums and leave your link behind. Be warned, not all bloggers like this method and may delete your comments.\n\nSubmitted Links – Your website ranking may also benefit from being listed on directories alongside similar websites. These will have to be submitted manually.\n\nAnd how will you know if it’s working?\n\nLike all SEO, the effects will not be visible over night, it requires a little patience. One of the easiest ways to see if your efforts are paying off is to search for a keyword from one of your pages and see where you rank in various search engines. Obviously, this isn’t a concrete measure, but it can tell you if you’re on the right track.

He found her Thursday morning outside the Social Security office while she was with her family.The husband argued with his wife until he pulled out a 9mm handgun and opened fire on everyone.The 51-year-old aunt and 64-year-old uncle died at the scene. The wife and her 28-year-old cousin were also shot and rushed to a trauma center in critical condition.Witness Mark Keszler told KSBW that the gunman showed very little emotion immediately after the shooting. \"The scariest part of it was that he was so stoic. He just didn’t have any kind of emotion, anything in his face. That was really chilling. It was like watching a horror film,\" Keszler said.More than 10 people called 911. Officers surrounded and locked down the area. The suspected shooter was pointed out to officers by witnesses, and he was taken to the police station.\"(Witnesses) assisted us and directed us to the identity of the suspect. The cooperation we got from witnesses out at the scene was extraordinary,\" Maiorana said.Police declined to release the names of the victims and suspected shooter.

We don’t know yet if there was premeditation, or if it was a spur of the moment thing,\" Maiorana said.Police do not believe the wife had a court-issued restraining order against her estranged husband.

The jump in volumes has stunned global markets, according to Morgan Stanley, while eliciting concern from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Exchanges in Asia’s top economy including in Shanghai have announced a series of measures this month to cool the frenzy, and said more steps may follow. “If you look at the client base of most Chinese exchanges, it’s heavily retail-focused,” Jones said on a panel discussion addressing commodities and risk management in China. The exchanges there “have very high retail participation. They have a very high velocity of trading,” he said.\n\nNow where have we seen this pattern of massive speculative volume rushing in from retail investors chasing a trend?\n\nThe speculative activities will be vulnerable to a sharp reversal, once the upward price momentum wanes, according to BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Group, drawing parallels with a rally, followed by a slump, in Chinese equities last year.\n\nAnd that did not end well for price action before in 2015...\n\nor 2009...\n\nAnd just as expected above...once the volume reaches a crescendo it crashes and The Party's Over\n\nAs reports from China suggest both major margin increases at the main exchanges and crackdowns on real", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

These bluffers use the word “meditation,” but they do not know the proper subject for meditation.

That is science.\n\nBill Faill: Do you feel that others may have possibly taught the genuine method of God consciousness?\n\nSrila Prabhupada: Unless I study their teachings in detail, it would be very difficult to say.

Ryan Zinke (R-MT), a former commander at the fabled Navy SEAL Team Six during an interview with Breitbart News Saturday host Matt Boyle on Sirius XM Patriot Radio Channel 125.\n\nMedical centers operated by President Barack Obama’s Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have come under fire in the last year for keeping long wait lists of veterans in need of essential care. Some veterans died while waiting for care.\n\nCongress’s only Navy SEAL veteran, who spent 23 years of his life defending the United States, recently came out in support of Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee.\n\n“I strongly endorse Donald Trump because we need a president that will put our veterans in front of the line rather than watch them die while in line,” declared Zinke on Breitbart News Saturday. “There’s a difference and the VA is broke.”\n\n“We need a businessman [like Trump] who’s not going to accept business as usual in Washington,” added the Montana Republican.\n\nThe problem with the Veterans Health Administration hospitals is “layers of bureaucracy getting into a system” that treats veterans “as a number” rather than human beings, pointed out Zinke, adding, “Not every veteran clinic is bad.”\n\nIn October, Trump unveiled a plan to reform the veterans health care system.\n\n“We’re going to take care of those wounded warriors and we’re going to take care of our vets better than anybody,” proclaimed the Republican candidate when announcing his proposal in Norfolk, VA, home to a sizable military population.\n\n“The plan will ensure our veterans get the care they need, wherever and whenever they need it,” he added.\n\nEarly this week, VA Secretary Robert McDonald drew sharp rebukes from Democrats and Republicans alike for downplaying the fatal impact of the wait times at VA medical centers by comparing them to lines at Disney theme parks.\n\nTrump condemned McDonald for making those comments.\n\n“I don’t agree with 100 percent of what Donald Trump says, but I agree…100 percent [that] we need to shake it up,” said Rep. Zinke, who served as deputy and acting commander of U.S. Special Forces in Iraq. “The status quo is not working and I believe that Donald Trump is going to be a phenomenal president.�", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 511}}

{"id": "sample_4_271", "config_id": 4, "prompt": " data on the first four days of open enrollment, and they smashed expectations. More than 600,000 signed up in that short time for coverage through the federal healthcare.gov website, a seemingly much faster pace than last year. Now, many caveats should be applied. It's merely four days, which isn't much of a sample size. With the open enrollment period being half as long, the daily average would have to be double just to sign up the same number of people as a year ago. All of the fundamentals that led experts to project lower enrollment this year still hold, especially given that premiums are skyrocketing for those who don't qualify for subsidies. But while the smart money may still point to a lower enrollment number, the early numbers should at least have everybody exploring the possibility of an increase in enrollment under Trump. We should be asking: If \"The Producers\" effect plays out, what would it look like?\n\nOne direct way in which Trump actions branded \"sabotage\" by Democrats could end up playing out differently is when it comes to CSR payments. On the surface, Trump's decision not to fund them would mean higher premiums and lower enrollment. However, insurers and state regulators have worked together to try and counteract this move, relying on Obamacare's other funding streams that are still flowing. Because Obamacare's core subsidies to help individuals purchase insurance are tied to the cost of silver plans, insurers have substantially hiked premiums on that category. This, in turn, means the government pays out more subsidies. Meanwhile, insurers have kept down premiums on bronze and gold plans. So, the increased subsidies could be used to offset the premium increases on silver plans, or they could be applied to the cheaper bronze plans, making them free or near free. Those who do not qualify for subsidies may find that bronze or gold plans did not go up by as much. Sure, there are unsubsidized consumers who may be priced out of enrolling. But there is the low hanging fruit of people who qualify for subsidies but have not enrolled in previous years. The prospect of a free bronze plan could be an attractive option for those who qualify for subsidies.\n\nBeyond some of the tangible effects of changes, there may be some intangible differences in the current political environment that one could see giving a lift to open enrollment. The months-long debate over repealing Obamacare, which was handled poorly by Republicans, ended up increasing the popularity of the law. Each drive for repeal was another opportunity for the law's supporters to educate the public about", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Data was collected on more than 750 hits to the head over the course of a season. With some impacts reaching magnitudes considered high even for college players, the findings provide the first quantitative assessment of the acceleration that young brains are exposed to in youth football.\n\nLead researcher Stefan Duma, who has been gathering data on head impacts among college players at Virginia Tech for nine seasons, describes the results of the youth study as “surprising.” “The highest impact we measured was 100g, which puts you right in the middle average of a concussion,” Duma tells Phillips.\n\nDr. Gunnar Brolinson, head of Virginia Tech’s Sports Medicine Department, remarks, “With the kids, when you start seeing 50, 60, 70, 80g blows, you’re just going ‘Wow!’ That is really impressive in terms of the load that’s occurring. And again, you’ve got a young athlete and a developing brain subject to those kinds of loads. So it’s concerning.”\n\nSignificantly, 29 of the top 38 hits and all impacts over 80gs occurred during practices. “This shows how important our research is. Without the sensors, we would never have known this. We can change the practices like we’ve done at college and dramatically minimize risk,” says Professor Duma.\n\nThe study, expected to be published this spring, was funded through a grant from NHTSA and conducted through the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest Center for Injury Biomechanics.\n\n“Hard Hits, Hard Numbers” features interviews with Stefan Duma, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Gunnar Brolinson, team doctor and head of Virginia Tech Sports Medicine, John Clark, coach of the participating youth football team, and team parents.\n\nStone Phillips, who suffered two sports-related concussions during his high school and college years, says, “We all know how fierce the hitting is in professional, college and even high school football.

Here are just a few possibilities:\n\n-- When last we saw Don, he was approached by a beautiful young woman in a dimly lighted bar while Megan was off filming a commercial she’d all but forced Don to cast her in. Maybe, in a moment of weakness, he flies off to Hawaii with said beauty and Megan follows him there in an attempt to win him back.\n\n-- Megan’s acting career takes off and she is cast in the pilot for “Hawaii Five-O,” which begain airing on CBS in September of 1968. (\"Mad Men’s\" most recent season ended in 1967.) While Megan is hard at work, Don slips off to a Don Ho concert where, drunk off of too many mai tais, he rushes the stage and is arrested. Mortified, Megan talks to Don about his drinking and decides that, for the health of their marriage, she will quit acting.\n\nPHOTOS: On the set of 'Mad Men'\n\n-- Megan and Don decide to repair their troubled marriage with a trip to Hawaii. Too bad they decided to do so in the middle of the eruption of Mt. Kilauea, which was highly active during 1967 and 1968. Nothing much happens but the bubbling lava provides the perfect visual metaphor for the volcanic rage just beneath the surface of their relationship.\n\n-- In a major coup for the agency, Don lands Spam as a client after pitching them a series of commercials set in Hawaii, where the canned meat product is unusually popular. He and Megan fly to the island to film the ads, in which she appears wearing a grass skirt and coconut bra. Megan, who has been attending consciousness-raising meetings back in New York, rankles at being objectified and she and Don get in their 7 millionth fight, only to make up later with a frisky roll in the sand.\n\nHave your own predictions?

What's in this little section here hardly scratches the surface.However, in terms of this section, it means that the ‘beta’ tag will be removed from the game. That is all this means. We will not stop developing the game or bringing new features in, we want to reassure every one of that. We will continue to work hard to improve and grow Infinity Wars from this point. We have some really great things coming in the future that we want you to get excited for.We believe that the game is strong enough to stand on its own without hiding behind the crutch of the Beta tag while we continue to develop content and features for Infinity Wars.We're a small indie studio, with an extreme amount of passion. Unfortunately passion doesn't fix everything. Our size (or lack thereof) will always play a part in the decisions we make and the timeframe it takes for things to happen.So, as a company, we have decided that now is the right time to remove that tag. With the game in (mostly) proper working order, the game is ready to bring your friends to as we continue to work on everything that's necessary while continuing to improve the game every single day.One of the things we’ve learned from the various advertising strategies (and we have tried many of them), is our game really is tailored for the mid to hardcore audience. We work hard to increase the spectrum of gamers this title could appeal to, but from the metrics shown from mainstream gaming coverage, the best thing we can do now is target gamers like yourselves.As such we have targeted advertising and marketing being rolled out, but this game will grow best from us bringing our TCG mates into a working game, hosting tournaments, and continuing to balance cards and bring new exiting content and mechanics into the game.Short answer? No. Long answer? In the beginning, we had said that when the game went Gold, we would reset rankings. We have decided not to do that at this current time. The reasoning behind this is… *points to the next section* (No really, look down.)Our next major milestone of version 1.5 focuses on the following, and we're starting work on this project once we confirm all the major bugs are squashed:We have a hopeful timeframe for these of within 6 months of going Gold, but we cannot make any promises on that just yet.

Many vegans proudly proclaim that their food is “cruelty-free” as though issues of justice and injustice begin and end with our use of nonhuman animals. What is probably an innocent shorthand for “no nonhuman animals were exploited to make this”, though, can appear as a complete disregard for the fact that many of the foods that we commonly consume are products of forced labour, human trafficking, exploitation and suffering.\n\nCertainly, there are more issues surrounding nonvegan consumption, and in no way can nonvegans hold the fact that food production systems are exploitative over us as a “gotcha”. Nor does the enormity of the exploitation in which the nonvegan participates by way of their food choices mean that we, as vegans, don’t have to try harder or do better.\n\nCashews are often processed by people who receive caustic burns from the acids that lie between the two layers of the hard shell of the nut. Some cashews are produced in forced-labour camps where the workers are beaten and shocked into harvesting, cleaning, and preparing a vegan staple. Much of the chocolate that we consume is the product of child labour, with reporters finding children as young as five using dangerous tools to harvest cocoa beans. Workers on coffee farms are often housed 40 to 60 to a room without sanitation, working without a signed contract and not receiving a minimum wage. Farm workers are frequently exposed to toxic chemicals, endangering their health and those of their families. And, in fact, an estimated sixty percent of child labour worldwide takes place in the agriculture sector.\n\nWhen we talk about cruelty-free food, then, we’re ignoring the fact that food production is bound up with many forms of injustice. At the very least, we ought to find another shorthand to convey the idea that our food does not contain animal bodies or products. But if we really take seriously the idea of living in a way that minimises harm, then we are morally obliged to educate ourselves on the human rights issues involved in food production, to support ethical and fair-trade companies where we can, and to learn more about where our food choices come from and how", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_4_294", "config_id": 4, "prompt": "At very high densities, populations of the largest herbivores, such as elephants, have devastating effects on the environment. What prevented widespread habitat destruction in the Pleistocene, when the ecosystem sustained many species of huge herbivores? We use data on predator–prey body mass relationships to predict the prey size ranges of large extinct mammalian carnivores, which were more diverse and much larger than living species. We then compare these prey size ranges with estimates of young mammoth sizes and show that juvenile mammoths and mastodons were within predicted prey size ranges of many of the Pleistocene carnivores. From this and other fossil evidence we argue that, by limiting population sizes of megaherbivores, large carnivores had a major impact on Pleistocene ecosystems.\n\nAbstract\n\nLarge mammalian terrestrial herbivores, such as elephants, have dramatic effects on the ecosystems they inhabit and at high population densities their environmental impacts can be devastating. Pleistocene terrestrial ecosystems included a much greater diversity of megaherbivores (e.g., mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths) and thus a greater potential for widespread habitat degradation if population sizes were not limited. Nevertheless, based on modern observations, it is generally believed that populations of megaherbivores (>800 kg) are largely immune to the effects of predation and this perception has been extended into the Pleistocene. However, as shown here, the species richness of big carnivores was greater in the Pleistocene and many of them were significantly larger than their modern counterparts. Fossil evidence suggests that interspecific competition among carnivores was relatively intense and reveals that some individuals specialized in consuming megaherbivores. To estimate the potential impact of Pleistocene large carnivores, we use both historic and modern data on predator–prey body mass relationships to predict size ranges of their typical and maximum prey when hunting as individuals and in groups. These prey size ranges are then compared with estimates of juvenile and subadult proboscidean body sizes derived from extant elephant growth data. Young proboscideans at their most vulnerable age fall within the predicted prey size ranges of many of the Pleistocene carnivores. Predation on juveniles can have a greater impact on megaherbivores because of their long interbirth intervals, and consequently, we argue that Pleistocene carnivores had the capacity to, and likely did, limit megaherbivore population sizes.At very high densities, populations of the largest herbivores,", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Minneapolis is home to one of the nation's largest Somali communities.\n\n“He came to the United States at a young age and is thankful to have had so many opportunities,” Thomas Plunkett, Noor’s attorney, said Monday. “…For him, being a police officer is a calling.”\n\nAbdikadir Hassan, a local community leader, told The Minneapolis Star Tribune that Noor was a role model.\n\n“He is inspiring to young people in the community,” Hassan said. “He is very supportive and good with the kids. He is such a lovely guy.”\n\nNoor, 31, attended Augsburg College in Minneapolis and earned a degree in business administration, management and economics, The Star Tribune reported.\n\nBut despite reportedly viewing the police force as his “calling,” Noor took a winding road to the department’s door. He first had jobs in residential property management and as the general manager of a hotel, according to The Star Tribune.\n\nIn his short time with the Minneapolis Police, Noor has had three complaints filed against him – two that are still open. The other was closed and Noor wasn’t disciplined.\n\nOn May 25, a woman accused Noor of assault and battery because he “grabbed her right wrist and upper arm” and inflamed a pre-existing shoulder injury while officers were forcibly removing her from her home and bringing her to a hospital.\n\nNoor, who spoke Somali at home, divorced his wife in December, but documents obtained by The Star Tribune also suggest he was a workaholic.\n\nAn evaluator was reportedly sent to observe Noor and his son together for an unspecified reason and concluded Noor had an “even keel and calm demeanor.”\n\nBut questions continue to surround Noor’s alleged actions on Saturday night.\n\nJustine Damond called police to report a possible crime occurring near her house. Officers arrived, and Noor, at some point, and for an as yet unknown reason, allegedly fired his gun, striking Damond in the abdomen and ultimately killing her.\n\nWhen she was shot, Damond was standing", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

The first leg of her flight was cancelled at very short notice, leaving her to take a roundabout route on Austrian Airlines, which resulted in them reaching their destination nearly four hours late.\n\nThe cancellation was due to a \"complex\" turbine engine failure, which took 10 days to fix. Predictably, the airline claimed this was an \"exceptional circumstance\".\n\nWallentin-Hermann decided to pursue her claim for the standard compensation, plus a small amount for telephone charges, in her local commercial court. Airlines have tended, since the current compensation regulations were introduced in 2004, not to defend claims from those passengers who actually use the courts.\n\nMost prefer not to risk setting an unfavourable and incontrovertible precedent, which could make it harder to fob off the majority who give up before resorting to litigation.\n\nAlitalia, however, decided to put its head above the pulpit, fighting the matter not only in the Austrian courts, but, when unsuccessful, appealing to the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe resulting decision will be welcome confirmation for passengers that routine technical faults are not \"exceptional\". The court's reasoning recognised that airlines invariably face technical problems. Checking for, and fixing these, is an inherent part of their business. The mere fact that an airline has complied with the legal minimum maintenance requirement will not exempt it from liability when something mechanical goes wrong.\n\nThe judgment does not go so far as to rule that mechanical defects could never amount to exceptional circumstances. The court recognised that a warning by the aircraft manufacturer leading to the removal from service of an entire fleet, or mechanical defects caused by terrorists or sabotage, could be treated differently.\n\nThe judgment was given in December last year, when it probably became known to the industry, but was only formally published earlier this month. This has a personal resonance, as I suffered a Swiss International Air (SIA) cancellation on Boxing Day due, apparently, to a failed autopilot.\n\nMy compensation claim – I only sought out-of-pocket losses, not the full EU set sum – was initially met with the same response as the Wallentin-Hermanns'. A couple of stroppy emails did persuade SIA to pay up, but it was disappointing that the airline continued to argue this issue even after the European Court decision.\n\nAirlines have no excuse now for not paying up; some will doubtless continue to try it", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

They would kill him,\" Lessing told a Swedish newspaper.\n\nPrinceton University political science professor-Melissa Harris-Lacewell echoed the same sentiment a month before, saying: \"For many black supporters, there is a lot of anxiety that he will be killed. It is on people’s minds.\"\n\n\"You can’t make a prediction like this – like he has a 50 per cent chance of getting shot.\"\n\n\"But the greater his visibility and the greater his access to people, there is a danger.\"\n\nSome speculated that Obama had been set up for an assassination attempt during a February 20 rally in Dallas, after it emerged that Secret Service gave the order to stop screening for weapons a full hour before the event began.\n\nClick here to listen to the", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

They say the demolitions are part of a broader campaign to target illegal structures in the province. They say church demolitions represent only a tiny fraction of their work.\n\nBut leaked party documents single out churches and folk religious sites in the so-called \"three rectifications and one demolition\" campaign. And church leaders like Chen say that the demolition campaign is merely a front for a crackdown to curtail Christianity's influence in the region.\n\nChurch leaders say that the central government has ignored all their complaints and petitions. They fear that the Wenzhou demolitions could be a test case for the party, an opening salvo in what could become a wider national campaign.\n\n\"The leaders think Christianity is a foreign religion and it is part of a foreign culture, which they define as 'western' culture,\" says Chen. \"They see our growth as an invasion of western culture into China.\"\n\nSince Chairman Mao's death in 1976, Christianity has taken hold in China. Though it is still a minority religion.\n\n\"Christianity has been growing very rapidly in China in the last several decades,\" says Fenggang Yang of Purdue University in Indiana. \"There is very little sign that it is slowing down.\"\n\nThe cross now lies under a cheap plastic tarpaulin at the foot of the church's stairs.\n\n\"It moved from a largely rural religion, came into the cities and became very popular with entrepreneurs. Many converts are now the youth.\"\n\nHe estimates that in a few years China will have more Christians than Communist Party members, which stood at more than 85 million in the last count.\n\nAnd in just 15 years, China could overtake the U.S. as the country with largest Christian population in the world. Chinese state media have disputed those claims.\n\n'Social glue'\n\nBack at the gray church, the Christians have managed to keep the demolition crews away for now. Their striking red cross sits above the church's spire. They often sing hymns to steel their resolve. \"The Cross Is My Glory\" by a Taiwanese composer has become a rallying cry in Wenzhou.\n\nThe congregation don't look like typical Chinese activists. There are elderly faithful with their grandchildren, wealthy-looking businessmen and clean-cut students.\n\nChen says, far from hurting the party, Christianity has been a refuge and social glue for many Chinese as income gaps rise and Chinese look for meaning. \"We", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Aiding and abetting this lie was Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who buried her own report that showed Obamacare would cost $400 billion more than promised in the first decade. It gets worse. The Government Accountability Office’s long-term projection reveals Obamacare raises the deficit over $1 trillion.\n\n“I can make a firm pledge.

Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital-gains taxes, not any of your taxes.” — Barack Obama, September 2008\n\nMr. Obama is now a Supreme Court-certified tax-raiser, which means his outright dishonesty has been validated by the high court as well. Despite the president’s public assurances to the contrary, his administration argued and five Supreme Court justices agreed that the individual-mandate penalty — the linchpin of Obamacare — is not actually a penalty, but is in fact a tax. What’s more, Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes on everything from pharmaceuticals and MRI scanners to tanning salons and the sale of your home.\n\n“But what we will do is, we’ll have the [Obamacare] negotiations televised on C-SPAN … .” — Barack Obama, August 2008\n\nMr. Obama promised the most transparent administration in American history.

Hancock said:\n\nThe age verification requirements apply to the commercial provision of pornography. Now commercial provision is not only paid for it’s also that which is provided for a commercial return. There is a difference between websites that provide commercial pornography and platforms on which others can upload images. And getting this right around that second group is much harder than around the first group.\n\nHe said the government wanted to put forward the bill to try to address age checks on porn sites. He then admitted: \"I appreciate for those who want to access porn online then, if they’re really intent on doing it, there is a big challenge in stopping that,\" before adding: \"platform-based pornography is a much more difficult technical nut to crack.\"\n\nWhich, perhaps put another way, suggests that the challenge is far more difficult because the likes of Twitter and Facebook aren't homegrown companies—making regulation very tricky.\n\nLater in the debate, Whittingdale urged caution on forcing ISPs to block \"legal content.\" He said: \"like it or not, the sites we are discussing are visited by millions and millions of people every day.\" The back bencher added that he supports age verification, even though it was yet to be made clear how the system would work. He argued that the government was \"asking a lot\" to expect porn users to dish up their credit card details.\n\n\"I personally was not persuaded about the necessity of introducing ISP blocking. It does represent a considerable infringement of civil liberties of individuals who are wanting to access material… at a time when we are concerned about censorship online… I do think this is a dangerous road to go down,\" Whittingdale said.\n\nNonetheless, the government's planned amendments to bring in ISP porn-blocking where sites fail to comply with age checks looks set to be waved through by MPs.\n\nAt time of publication, parliamentarians had finally begun talking about Part 5 of the draft Digital Economy Bill.

A map that is very infamous for its CT favorability and insanely short rotation times is Train. Though recently redubbed to give aid to the Terrorist side, the map still stands as CT sided. If an aim duel is occuring between a Terrorist at the Popdog location and a CT holding the same angle from connector and both decide leave at the exact same time to peek each other again at lower B, the CT will reach the angle just over 5 seconds earlier than the Terrorist. This shows that with even with perfect intel on where the CT’s are located, the Terrorists are at a huge time disadvantage.\n\nFigure showing the rotation path of each player described above\n\nAngle Amount\n\nAngle amount is how many positions the CT’s have to hide in to hold an angle. Angle amount is the reason Inferno’s B site is an Entry fraggers worst nightmare. There are an ungodly number of angles that Terrorists have to check, one by one, to clear the site. It’s a guessing game when trying to take B Site, as any of the spots has the potential to be occupied, and the first Terrorist in is often bait just to find out where the defenders are and is rarely able to make a trade. The more angles there are to check, the harder the site is to capture.\n\nA Terrorist walking onto the site has to check these seven common angles, not including some uncommon spots\n\nNumber of Choke Points\n\nChoke points are the entrances into a bomb site. How many options do the Terrorists have when entering a site and how different those options are gives both sides very different choices. A map known very being balanced, Dust 2’s B site shows us the importance of entering a site from multiple angles. With no middle control, if a Terrorist team wishes to take B site, all their forces must go through a single entry point. With so many potential CT positions, combined with only a single entry point, B site can become a slaughterhouse for our Elite crew in that scenario. But with the addition of Terrorist mid control, the entire situation changes. Now with three potential entry points, any CT trapped in the site must divide their attention to try to cover all the entrances.

This summer, virtually every team in the league has enough cap room to make a splashy move. The Washington Wizards are among those teams.\n\nSince everyone has beaten the Kevin Durant topic to death, we won’t even bother rehashing what happened. The Wizards have to focus on other free agents, even if they are obscure.\n\nFinding a gem in free agency could make the difference between a first round playoff exit and a trip to the conference finals.\n\nOften times the players that make the most impact are the ones that fly under the radar; the ones casual fans have never heard of.\n\nThe teams with the best scouts, in particular the San Antonio Spurs, always find a way to get the lead on players we’ve never come across. That won’t change this summer.\n\nAccording to EuroHoops, the Spurs and the Washington Wizards are interested in Giannis Bourousis.\n\nA total of six NBA teams are interested on Giannis Bourousis and as Eurohoops can confirm the Washinton Wizards and the San Antonio Spurs are two of the suitors.\n\nPer EuroHoops, Bourousis “was the MVP of Liga Endesa and the best center in Euroleague.” That’s kind of impressive.\n\nLike most of you, I’ve never heard of the player nor will I pretend to know how good he is. But, l have excellent YouTubing and Googling abilities that I’ve put to the test in order to learn more about the district’s potential savior.\n\nBourousis can obviously space the floor. At the next level, he would probably be considered a stretch five. He also seems to have solid court vision, which is a huge plus for bigs in the NBA.\n\nFrom the other things I’ve gathered, he doesn’t seem like a great defender nor someone who would excel against quick-footed bigs. That applies to plenty of other bigs, though. Bourousis’ game could be compared to Mo Speights’.\n\nThe 32-year", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

An 11th teenager was captured on video being led away from a Montreal home by investigators. None of the teenagers have been identified publicly and no charges were laid.\n\nThe government may opt not to pursue a criminal case for fear that any public trial could force it to reveal sensitive intelligence methods – a situation that is a chronic issue in Canadian counterterrorism cases.\n\nThe passport confiscations recalled last fall's terror attacks in which two lone-wolf assailants each killed Canadian soldiers after they were thwarted in attempts to travel abroad and possibly join jihadi groups. Officials provided no answer when asked how they might prevent similar backlash in the latest cases.\n\nThe arrests again turned scrutiny toward a pre-university in Montreal's east end. Four of the people arrested on the weekend attended Maisonneuve College. A total of 11 alleged extremist recruits have now come from the school, which again denied it has a radicalization problem. \"It's increasingly clear youth recruitment is happening through social media,\" a statement issued by the school said.\n\nObservers are increasingly asking whether the threat to Canada can be contained if the ranks of extremists and thwarted jihadis continue to grow.\n\nThe RCMP's terrorism prevention program is designed to intervene before suspects mobilize toward violence, but the details of the program remain murky. In Quebec, Premier Philippe Couillard has promised oft-delayed legislation to deal with radicalization. He said a new law will be presented within weeks, meaning it will be months before any new program is enacted.\n\nThe City of Montreal has announced a radicalization-prevention centre, but so far it amounts to a phone number at police headquarters.

Prosecutors know it is harder to get a death sentence,” the center’s executive director, Richard Dieter, told Reuters.\n\nThe last planned execution in the United States for 2013 took place on Tuesday in Oklahoma, when the state killed by lethal injection a man convicted of stabbing and beating a horse trainer to death in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nThe center said so far this year 80 individuals were sentenced to death, fewer than the 315 death sentences meted out in both 1994 and 1996, representing recent historical high numbers. The 2013 tally was also the lowest for a single year since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Americans say they favor the death penalty for convicted murderers, polling group Gallup said in October.\n\nGallup said the number marks the lowest level of support it has measured since November 1972, when 57 percent were in favor. Death penalty support peaked at 80 percent in 1994.\n\nDieter said the decline in death sentences has been accompanied by an increase in sentences of life imprisonment without parole.\n\n“Jurors like that option,” he said.\n\nBEING SELECTIVE\n\nProsecutors who support the death penalty, like Susan Reed, the district attorney in San Antonio, said they consider costs in pursuing a capital punishment conviction, which usually involves years of expensive mandatory appeals.\n\n“We are now very selective in what we choose to go after as death penalty cases, instead of deciding that every single murder that we try will be a capital case,” Reed told Reuters.\n\nSeveral states have had trouble procuring drugs for lethal injections because pharmaceutical companies have shied away from direct sales, not wanting to be associated with executions.\n\nSix states have repealed capital punishment in the last seven years, the center said, with Maryland being the latest.\n\nMaryland Governor Martin O’Malley said in May when he signed the measure: “Over the longer arc of history, I think you’ll see more and more states repeal the death penalty.

What comes to mind is that scene in Lord of the Rings where the orcs are running around like crazy in their underground fortress.\n\nSo, I expected something a little more havoc-filled than what I found when I arrived at Barcade in Williamsburg at around 9:30 Friday night: about a half-dozen very normal-looking young men and one young woman crowded around a table, lit up by blinking 1980s arcade games that lined the room. Their 4channess was signaled only by the woman's iPhone 4, on which she had loaded a picture of \"Troll Face,\" a crudely drawn caricature that's sort of a 4chan logo. She waved it around like a beacon.\n\nUpon sitting down, I was relieved to see that none of the assembled 4channers looked very capable of violence. Relieved, because this summer, some 4chan users declared war on me and Gawker over a few blog posts I wrote about the site's role in harassing an 11-year-old viral video star. They brought down Gawker, prank called me and tried sending a bunch of cardboard boxes to my house. (The address was wrong; some random Chinese lady in Queens got the boxes.) Before heading to the meet-up, I steeled myself with beer, figuring it would hurt less to be felled by a 4channer's poison blade if I was sort of tipsy.\n\nBut all the 4channers here were friendly; the few that recognized my name actually seemed excited to meet me. They were like kids in the cafeteria on the first day of school, eagerly recounting the crazy stuff they did over the summer. They talked about memes, pranks, video games, 4chan's bad rep (not completely unearned, most seemed to agree). A musician named JP explained the sense of release.\n\n\"Normally I'm very careful not to tell a lot of people that I go on 4chan,\" he told me. \"I don't want them to go on there, see some child porn or something, and be like, 'What the hell is this guy into?'\"\n\nStill, they were definitely 4channers: At one point Alex, a disheveled pharmacy student in a grey hoodie and steel-framed glasses, pointed at me and said, \"You know who you look like?

Everything that I know about myself tells me that he and I would enjoy each others company … at least I would, and that’s 87% of the reason he and I should be hanging out. Interestingly enough, when I find some downtime and I want to randomly search the internet, I start with Peter Zumthor. Most recently, I stumbled upon an article that I enjoyed quite a bit and it ended with a quote that cemented my logic for why he and I should be internet best friends.\n\nThe article I read was on Peter Zumthor and his Zinc Mine Museum Project in Norway, and I found it in the digital version of Icon magazine. In this article, Zumthor discusses the project and addresses the numerous delays – some of which can be attributed to Zumthor’s legendary perfectionism. What I really enjoyed was the final two paragraphs that explained Zumthor’s take on the sometimes timely process of creating architecture in a methodical and exacting method.\n\nI don’t want to be slow,” Zumthor explains of his uncompromising method, taking a sip of his cappuccino. “I’m a fast thinker, and I don’t want it to take more time than it takes. But sometimes it takes a while to develop something, you have to make samples and mock-ups, sometimes it takes time to find out what the building really wants to be. I imagine my buildings so completely, I unconsciously live in them. And all of a sudden I feel, hey shit, something’s wrong. “There’s this corner that doesn’t work or whatever. That’s the artistic process. It’s grounded to artists, and it should also be grounded to architects who work like building artists. This is not slowness, this is just working like an architect-artist. This is how I need to work and I need a client who understands it, and wants it, and knows that this can get on your nerves sometimes.” “The finished building,” he adds, with a chuckle, “is your best argument.”\n\nHow can you not love that?

Sessions is, of course, the Republican party’s famous immigration hawk — a fierce, and fiercely intelligent, opponent of unchecked immigration, of amnesty, and of the various abuses of visa programs that large businesses use to undermine American labor. So, naturally, he endorsed the candidate who has proposed a de facto amnesty in which the federal government would first expend astronomical quantities of money and labor to round up 11 million illegal immigrants residing in the country, escort them to their home countries — and then let them back in (provided, of course, that they’re sufficiently “terrific”); he endorsed the candidate who has abused the H-2B visa system to import foreign workers to do “jobs Americans won’t do” — like model fashion; and he endorsed the candidate who has employed illegal immigrants on his building projects as recently as July of last year. Perhaps the senator thinks that Donald Trump, having touted his promises so publicly, will be made to go through with them. If so, he should consult with Trump’s business associates, employees, and two ex-wives about the reliability of Mr. Trump’s promises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne must add to this list Maine governor Paul LePage — apparently now taking his political advice from Smoothie and D-Money — congressmen Duncan Hunter (Calif.) and Chris Collins (N.Y.), former Arizona governor Jan Brewer, and Sarah Palin.

It is also the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide.\n\nThe disease is not strongly associated with any symptoms and early detection is often by chance. Current methods of detection are unreliable and scientists have been working on using exhaled breath specimens from patients for future screening tests.\n\nThis method relies on identifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are linked to the presence of cancer. Although many different technological applications have been developed, this method is still difficult to apply in a clinical setting as patients aren't allowed to smoke or eat before the test, sample analysis can take a long time and there is also a high risk of interference. Because of these reasons, no lung cancer-specific VOCs have yet been identified.\n\nThis new study aimed to assess whether sniffer dogs could be used to identify a VOC in the breath of patients. The researchers worked with 220 volunteers, including lung cancer patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and healthy volunteers. They used dogs that had been specifically trained.\n\nThe researchers carried out a number of tests to see if the dogs were able to reliably identify lung cancer compared with healthy volunteers, volunteers with COPD and whether the results were still found with the presence of tobacco.\n\nThe dogs successfully identified 71 samples with lung cancer out of a possible 100. They also correctly detected 372 samples that did not have lung cancer out of a possible 400.\n\nThe dogs could also detect lung cancer independently from COPD and tobacco smoke. These results confirm the presence of a stable marker for lung cancer that is independent of COPD and also detectable in the presence of tobacco smoke, food odours and drugs.\n\nAuthor of the study, Thorsten Walles from Schillerhoehe Hospital, said: \"In the breath of patients with lung cancer, there are likely to be different chemicals to normal breath samples and the dogs' keen sense of smell can detect this difference at an early stage of the disease. Our results confirm the presence of a stable marker for lung cancer.

Clinton and her useful liberal idiots jumped on Donald Trump’s Second Amendment comment like a dog on a juicy T-bone steak, but they should have glanced back at the skeletons in her closet before opening their mouths quite so wide and loudly.\n\nDuring a 2008 interview, Hillary Clinton was being asked about dropping out of the race since she was losing to Barack Obama.\n\nHillary said she shouldn’t get out of the race, as things often change in June after the California primary – then pointed out that Bobby Kennedy was assassinated after that primary. The implication taken by many was that because Obama was Black, there was a very good chance an assassination attempt would be made on him!\n\nSome even made the argument she was putting that mandate out there to her thugs and she all but expected it to happen.\n\nThe news media at the time went nuts—but just briefly.\n\nSocial media was still in its infancy, so the Hillary recording was left on a dusty shelf somewhere. Until now.\n\nClinton hates to be reminded of her past comments and stances, and she often lies or accuses others of lying about what she said and did even when caught red-handed.\n\nUnlike Hillary, Donald Trump did not use the word “assassinate” or even reference her name in the sentence liberal pundits equated to a kill order.\n\nAnyone with an ounce of common sense in their head did not think Donald Trump was asking Second Amendment supporters to go shoot Hillary Clinton.\n\nNeither NRA members nor Second Amendment advocates from some other related group have ever been involved in an assassination attempt, hate crime, or other type of mass shooting.\n\nAlthough I have not verified this fact via extensive research, it appears NRA members and Second Amendment supporters have an extremely small to non-existent history of violent acts or crimes when compared to the general population.\n\nto discuss this story.Is Hillary’s memory slipping or is it just selective?

The only way for that to happen, Santorum said, is for the GOP establishment to give the embattled Akin its full-fledged support.\n\n\"The entire Republican Party should stand up and say, 'You know what? He's our candidate, it's too important for the future of our country not to have a majority of the Senate in this upcoming election,\" Santorum said when asked if Romney needs to publicly support Akin. \"I'm hoping everybody will join in and support the cause.\"\n\nThe former Pennsylvania senator and unsuccessful president candidate joined South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint in announcing their support of Akin on Wednesday.\n\n\"I don't know what the Republican establishment -- what their objective is, but if they want to repeal Obamacare, we better hold the Senate. And to hold the Senate, we better win Missouri,\" Santorum said.\n\nAkin has taken heat from both sides of the aisle after using the term \"legitimate rape\" and saying women have a biological way of preventing unwanted pregnancies while he gave a now-notorious explanation of his views on abortion.\n\n\"My feeling is that we can win the presidency, but if we don't have 51 senators, we're not going to be able to repeal Obamacare,\" said Santorum.\n\nRomney's former rival has been active campaigning for the presidential candidate in the Buckeye State. It's a primary Santorum nearly won on Super Tuesday, and his support was particularly strong in this part of the state, heavy with blue-collar workers and not far from his home of Pittsburgh.\n\nDespite recent polls showing Romney needing to make up significant ground in Ohio, the former senator remained optimistic about the state turning red. \"I'm confident that Mitt Romney will win Ohio, will when the presidency,\" he said. \"People here understand how dangerous this president is.\"\n\nThat danger, Santorum said, stems from the president's energy policy, which he claims makes the U.S. more dependent on foreign oil. It is a message the Romney campaign hopes will resonate in this coal-rich part of the state. It is here where Republicans go to hammer Obama for waging a \"war on coal.\"\n\n\"This is a president that is going to drive this country to economic ruin because of a phony ideology that, you know, somehow or another he has to control the seas rising and falling,\" Santorum said.\n\nWhile Santorum has been traveling as a Romney surrogate", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Coffee prices have rallied almost 50pc in the past few weeks due to the drought in Brazil, which grows 40pc of the world’s beans.\n\n“Suddenly, out of nowhere we have seen weather risk creep back into the market,” said Ms Haque.\n\nGas alert If Putin turns off the taps over Crimea, expect fuel costs to rocket\n\nBefore US president Barack Obama warned Russia’s Vladimir Putin against a further escalation in Ukraine, his advisers would have been wise to explain just how crucial Russia has become to the global economy through its supply of commodities, especially gas.\n\nFrom its mines deep in the Urals to oil wells across Siberia, pictured left, Russia now has the ability to choke off international markets from key resources such as oil, gas and minerals. In any confrontation with Europe and the US over Ukraine’s Crimea region, Moscow could simply halt shipments.\n\nIn the UK, the immediate effect would be dramatic, probably causing a sudden rise in petrol and gas heating prices. Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia and the US, giving it the power to dramatically influence crude prices.\n\nBut it is in gas supply where Russia holds all the cards. The US Energy Information Administration says Moscow dominates Europe’s gas supply market, shipping 76pc of its exports of the heating fuel to the region last year. The UK, Germany, Italy and France were the main recipients of that gas.\n\nIn 2009, the last time Russia locked horns with Ukraine and disrupted gas piped to Europe, UK prices jumped by 17pc in just two weeks. Although stockpiles are now higher, the impact of Russia turning off the gas would still result in electricity prices rising overnight.\n\nUS oil gains continue\n\nOil traded in the US completed its second consecutive month of price gains last week amid tighter supplies from the Bakken shale region of North Dakota,", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

(“An employee may place most types of assets into a blind trust portfolio. These initial assets continue to pose a conflict of interest until they have been sold or reduced to a value of less than $1,000. Any new assets purchased by the independent trustee may not be disclosed to the employee and therefore will not present a conflict of interest. . . . An employee can place only readily marketable securities in the trust portfolio and the portfolio must meet certain diversification standards. The initial assets of a diversified trust are not considered to pose a conflict of interest because the portfolio is so diversified that an official action taken by the employee would not have a direct and predictable effect on the value of the portfolio.”)\n\nTrump initially claimed none of the conflict-of-interest rules applied to him. He is technically right with regard to domestic holdings. However, now Trump seems to have recognized it is just “not appropriate” to be holding stocks when he is making decisions that would affect them. He is precisely right. He claims to have sold his stock — although there is no documentation to that effect, and he refuses to release his tax returns. But wait. There is absolutely no difference between his stock portfolio and his active businesses; in fact, the conflict is much worse and more obvious when we are talking about an international family business. When a president runs on a platform of “draining the swamp,” he cannot very well do less than that required for every person who works for him.\n\nFinally, there is the emoluments clause problem which, if he were president today, he’d be violating each and every day. As ethics gurus Norman L. Eisen and Richard W. Painter wrote:\n\nWe are in danger of having a president who could violate it if he does not disentangle his business operations from foreign governments. The potential violations also include the benefits conferred on Trump in connection with outstanding loans from the Bank of China, which is controlled by the Chinese government, as well as any investment or involvement of sovereign wealth funds in his many projects around the globe, and foreign governments putting up their officials or diplomats at Trump hotels or even those", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

The strength of the magnetic storm means northern lights could be visible as far south as the Detroit and Chicago areas.\n\nA large sunspot erupted September 4, 2017, throwing a coronal mass ejection (CME) toward the earth. A coronal mass ejection is a huge explosion of magnetic field and plasma from the Sun's corona. When CMEs impact the Earth's magnetosphere, they are responsible for geomagnetic storms and enhanced auroras, according to NOAA.\n\nNOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center has issued a Strong Magnetic Storm Watch for the nights of Sept. 6 and Sept. 7.

Northern lights are typically visible as far south as a kP value of 7.\n\nOn the map above, I drew the expected location of the kP=7. So northern lights may be visible as far south as the Detroit area, Chicago, Cleveland, Des Moines and Syracuse, NY.\n\nBut you won't be able to see the northern lights in the big cities. You will have to get out into the countryside where it's completely dark.\n\nTo get updated info on the northern lights, go here.\n\nThere is a good factor pointing toward seeing the northern lights in the next two nights. Skies at night should generally be more clear than cloudy in the Great Lakes region. We will have afternoon showers pop up both today and Thursday. At night those showers should diminish. While the skies may not clear entirely in all locations, the spotty showers will just leave isolated clouds in most areas.\n\nThe negative to watching northern lights tonight and Thursday is a nearly full moon. The bright full moon we have been enjoying the past two nights will throw light up into the sky. The extra moonlight won't totally block out northern lights hopes, but could make them harder to see in marginal northern lights areas.\n\nGet a nap in this evening, and head to a dark location toward midnight.\n\nAny questions or comments, please post below.UPDATE:\n\nLarge geomagnetic", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

For some individuals subject to a detainer, it could take many months or even years—given the Immigration Court's backlog—to work their way through civil proceedings and actually be ordered deported. For others, deportation might be delayed until individuals finished serving their prison sentence if they were convicted of committing a serious crime. Further, the expanded coverage of SCOMM gave ICE a greatly increased volume of fingerprint records to review, allowing it to refine and perhaps better target how and when detainers were used. This might lead to a higher proportion that resulted in an actual deportation. A more detailed comparison - month-by-month—covering October 2012 through December 2015—highlights the role of detainers starting when SCOMM became fully functional in nearly all communities, and ending thirteen months after the announcement that the SCOMM program was being replaced by Homeland Security's Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) . See Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 plots the actual number of removals, while Figure 5 shows these trends as a proportion of ICE removals from the interior of the country. As before, both detainers and notices are included in these plots.\n\nFigure 4. ICE Deportations With Prior Detainer by Month Figure 4. ICE Deportations With Prior Detainer by Month Both graphs show a similar pattern of decline, with a modest temporary upsurge starting the month before the official announcement of SCOMM's replacement by PEP.

Percent of ICE Interior Deportations With Prior Detainer by Month Improvements in ICE Transparency Needed Despite TRAC's new findings, additional unanswered questions remain. First, these findings focus on trends at the national level. There is no geographic breakdown because ICE did not release the needed geographic data. Further, with President Trump's new executive orders, an even wider range of information is now needed to monitor how these policies will be implemented. However, the outlook for public access to the information required to monitor the detainer program is not promising. A recent and dramatic change in ICE FOIA policies occurred in the waning months of the Obama Administration. These changes in FOIA policies appear to be designed to drastically restrict the already limited flow of data the agency releases to the public.

{"id": "sample_4_393", "config_id": 4, "prompt": " Noah was back in his comfort zone Friday night.\n\nWithout Derrick Rose (knee) or Pau Gasol (illness), and with Taj Gibson going down with an ankle injury after just nine minutes, the remaining Bulls had to pull together and do a little more. For Noah, that meant he was back in a familiar role as a \"point center,\" a role he played extremely well without Rose on the floor over the past two years. With Noah back at the high post, he looked more confident on the floor, as he racked up 11 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in a 96-89 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n\"That's what Jo wants to do -- handle the ball,\" Bulls swingman Jimmy Butler said. \"He makes great decisions when he's passing it, and he's aggressive when he gets it. Whenever you have a big man like that, it's hard to guard all five people on the floor.\"\n\nNoah had much more space on the floor offensively, without Gasol down on the blocks. The pair know they need one another to reach their ultimate goal, but they have not played well together throughout much of this season. Noah thrives in a situation in which he can pass the ball in various sets from the high post.\n\n\"That part I think is innate,\" Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said of Noah's passing ability. \"He had great vision and decision-making ability. He's got a very unorthodox game in many ways. But he's got great vision, and if a guy's open just a little bit on a cut, he can get it there. So it's a big plus when you have a big guy that can pass like that.\"\n\nFor his part, Noah wasn't biting on how much fun he was having in his old role. He discussed how the Bulls run a read-and-react offense and try to find the open man.\n\n\"I enjoy winning,\" Noah said. \"It was fun to win today. We just got to keep improving.\"\n\nNoah's offensive game has taken a back seat to Gasol's throughout the season. Now that Noah is back to feeling like himself as he continues to shake off the lingering effects of offseason knee surgery, it's going to be interesting to see how his game responds once Gasol and Rose are back on the floor. In the meantime, Noah, like the rest of his teammates, is just hopeful Rose will be back sooner than later.\n\n\"It", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}
{"id": "sample_4_394", "config_id": 4, "prompt": "? Did the corporate office simply decide that the time had come to give workers a good scare? And did the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency of the Department of Homeland Security help them? It wouldn’t be the first time.\n\nIn each of the past five years, ICE has audited the records of more than 2,000 employers, ordering them to fire undocumented workers. The mass firings include thousands of janitors and sewing-machine operators, as well as workers in farms, factories and meatpacking plants. Now these so-called “silent raids” have arrived at fast-food joints, just in time to scare workers as they stage more walkouts and protests.\n\nThe government says forcing bosses to fire workers is more humane than deporting them. Instead of mounting the kind of factory raids immigration authorities did a few years ago, with black-clad agents carrying machine guns, ICE now says it uses this “softer” method. It has an electronic system to find and fire the undocumented – a database called E-Verify.\n\nICE says it targets employers who force substandard wages or working conditions on their employees. But curing intolerable conditions by firing or deporting workers doesn’t help the workers. And in the fast-food restaurants, the conditions don’t change just because people get fired for not having good papers.\n\nBeneath the benevolent-sounding rhetoric is a whispered subtext, as well. If “those people” without papers can’t work, they’ll leave. But no one is heading for Mexico. People stay, but instead they lose homes and pull their kids from school, while looking for work on street corners or cleaning other people’s homes.\n\nIn 1999 unions said they would try to put a stop to this. At the AFL-CIO convention, they said they’d help immigrant workers get organized to raise wages and make conditions better. Unions would campaign to repeal the law, called “employer sanctions,” that makes it a crime for someone without papers to hold a job to support his or her family. But today Congress is debating laws that would make these firings even more widespread, and criminalize people even more. These bills come from the Tea Party and mainstream Democrats, who see no problem in firing workers for not having papers.\n\nMaybe it’s because they just don’t see or hear the workers.

He calls me his lil’ Shake Weight™.\n\nQuick timeout with my man, Cable. He’s amazing. Even though sometimes it feel like he doesn’t know I exist. But I’m drinking MILK. Which means I’ll grow up someday and pull all the blood out of his f*cking body.\n\nRyan Reynolds is reprising his role as the Merc with a Mouth alongside Zazie Beetz as the luck-manipulating mutant Domino and Josh Brolin as Cable, the time-traveling son of the X-Men’s Cyclops.

Dion also said pulling out Canada’s jets would be done in conjunction with Canada’s allies and rolled out alongside a new plan, but he never hinted that the defining issue would be “capability.”\n\nSajjan also said he is considering leaving Canada’s air refueling and reconnaissance aircraft as part of the mission.\n\nThe Conservative defence critic James Bezan responded to Sajjan, demanding to see the details of the Liberal plan for the military mission. He believes there have been contradictory messages sent about the nature of the mission and whether the Liberal government will eventually put more boots on the ground.\n\n“I’m looking forward to seeing exactly what the plan is because that wasn’t apparent,” says Bezan. “The defence minister is using language that’s quite different from what we’re hearing from the Prime Minister,” he said.\n\nBezan said the Prime Minister has said in the House that Canada needs to fight ISIS in its own territory. “Does that mean boots on the ground?” he asked.\n\nThe defence minister joined Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Pearson airport on Thursday night to greet the incoming Syrian refugees, but Sajjan says the government is trying to avoid using military bases to house more refugees.\n\n“We are trying to, hopefully, not even be able to use military bases, but if it’s needed, we are available for that purpose,” the minister said.\n\nToday the threat level from ISIS was raised in Geneva after suspects related to the Paris attacks are being tracked by police, but the defence minister maintains his previous statement that Canada has nothing to fear from ISIS.\n\n“Canada should not fear ISIS, and I am firm believer in that,” he said. “Canadians should feel safe but that does not mean that we are going to eliminate all threats, but we have security forces that 24/7 are looking out for these types of threats,” he said.\n\nSajjan also said his most important job is protecting the mental health of the men and women in the Canadian military.\n\nThe comments came in a wide ranging interview ton “Everything is", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

They’ve got us here; we might as well be on that racetrack putting on a show for the fans.\n\nQ: At the start of this year, exactly 2,900 drivers had ever raced in the Sprint Cup Series. Where do you rank among those 2,900?\n\nA: Damn! I have no idea. The stats — you could quickly look that up and figure it out. It’s hard to judge that over the years, because if I could run three times a week like they did (in NASCAR’s early days), I think you could improve your results. Everybody always tries to judge racing as you see it today to racing as you saw it back then, and it’s just simply not matchable.\n\nThey had one car they raced; we have a fleet of cars that are built differently for different tracks. They had five employees; we have 500 employees. You know what I mean? It’s so different. It’s hard to judge where a guy like Dale Earnhardt ranks, let alone yourself.\n\nQ: What do you think your reputation is, and is that reputation accurate?\n\nA: (Laughs) Probably pretty accurate! I think everybody knows that I like having fun. The biggest thing is, people can be misled into thinking I’m not being serious. When I’m competing, I’m dead serious and I want to beat these guys. That’s something that’s misunderstood about me sometimes. But that’s what I love about this sport — the media and TV do such a good job of covering the sport itself that you understand the characters within the people, and that’s why fans have such strong thoughts on any specific driver.\n\n\"It would be a lot of fun to laugh with somebody in the car, because I’m usually either laughing at myself or by myself on somebody else’s behalf,\" Clint Bowyer says.

(Courtesy of Rob Shenk | Creative Commons)\n\nOn Jan. 4th, Mayor Jim Kenney signed a law that no longer allows Philadelphia law enforcement and federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to cooperate, reverting Philadelphia back to a “sanctuary city.”\n\nBefore the executive order, ICE could ask city police to hold onto undocumented immigrants who would have been released while awaiting trial. The undocumented immigrants would then be kept in police custody until ICE picked them up and faced potential deportation. Previous mayor, 1979 Wharton graduate Michael Nutter, made Philadelphia a sanctuary city before reversing his own decision in late 2015.\n\nPenn Democrats Communications Director and College junior Luke Hoban supports Mayor Kenney's plan and believes that Philadelphia needs to have some role in helping immigrants and refugees.\n\n“Whatever measures that need to be taken should be implemented to make sure immigrants are not forced back to regions of the world that they are fleeing and giving up their lives in many cases, in hope of resettling here to provide a better life for themselves and their children,\" Hoban said.\n\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who promotes a program called \"Priority Enforcement” that has been decried by immigrant advocacy groups as overly aggressive, has worked with Kenney to switch programs. Until these discussions take place, Kenney told The Philadelphia Inquirer that Philadelphia will not force cops to cooperate with the ICE.\n\nOther sanctuary cities in the United States include New York City, Baltimore and Washington D.C.. However, the Brookings Institution found in 2014 that Philadelphia is one of the \"re-emerging gateways\" in America due to a resurgence in the amount of immigrants entering the city each year.\n\nProponents of Philadelphia as a sanctuary city say that it improves relations between the community and the police. For example if an undocumented immigrant is a witness of crime, they will be able to report the crime without fear of deportation. Proponents also reason that being a sanctuary city encourages immigration to cities, which can benefit the city's economy.\n\nA 2012 study by the Partnership for a New American Economy found that immigrants start 28 percent of small businesses even though they make up only 12.9 percent of the United States population", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

At full pelt, light would travel about 18 million kilometres in that time – that’s more than 20 round trips to the moon.\n\n“One minute is extremely, extremely long,” says Thomas Krauss at the University of St Andrews, UK. “This is indeed a major milestone.”\n\nThe feat could allow secure quantum communications to work over long distances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile light normally travels at just under 300 million metres per second in a vacuum, physicists managed to slow it down to just 17 metres per second in 1999 and then halt it completely two years later, though only for a fraction of a second. Earlier this year, researchers kept it still for 16 seconds using cold atoms.\n\nStripy light\n\nTo break the minute barrier, George Heinze and colleagues at the University of Darmstadt, Germany, fired a control laser at an opaque crystal, sending its atoms into a quantum superposition of two states. This made it transparent to a narrow range of frequencies. Heinze’s team then halted a second beam that entered the crystal by switching off the first laser and hence the transparency.\n\nThe storage time depends on the crystal’s superposition. A magnetic field extends it but complicates the control laser configuration. Heinze’s team used an algorithm to “breed” combinations of magnet and laser, leading them to one that trapped light for a minute.\n\nThey also used the trap to store and then retrieve an image consisting of three stripes. “We showed you can imprint complex information on your light beam,” says Heinze.\n\nTens of seconds of light storage are needed for a device called a quantum repeater, which would stop and then re-emit photons used in secure communications, to preserve their quantum state over long distances.\n\nIt should even be possible to achieve longer light storage times with other crystals, says Heinze, as they have pushed their current material close to its physical limit.\n\nJournal reference: Physical Review Letters, doi.org/m86(Image: Dougal Waters/Getty)\n\nThe fastest thing in the universe has come to a complete stop for a record-breaking minute.

Keuchel (20-8, 2.48) won his first Cy Young Award last season, went an astounding 15-0 with a 1.46 ERA in Minute Maid Park and was the winning pitcher in Yankee Stadium in the wild card game. Correa (.279-22-68) is, simply put, the future of the sport, a precocious “early years A-Rod” clone who is to the Astros what J.J. Watt is to the Texans. If any of these three is not playing in the All-Star Game in July, chances are the Astros are not in first place at that time.\n\nThe construction of a roster in sports is a fluid, ongoing, never-ending process. A roster can age over a period of a few seasons, become more expensive and then snap back to a younger, cheaper form if that’s what’s deemed necessary. As they plummeted to the depths of baseball hell from 2011 through 2013, the Astros’ roster damn near scaled back to being an embryo, with a payroll in 2013 that was below $20 million at one point.\n\nThose days are long gone, yet while their payroll this season should approach $100 million, the Astros are still near the bottom of baseball in money spent on players’ salaries. That’s largely a function of the age of the team, still one of baseball’s youngest, with many players still under team control, clocking in at or near minimum salary.\n\nAnd that leads to the elephant in the room — what will Jim Crane do when it comes time to pay his core players market value? Keuchel is making $7.25 million in 2016 after arbitration, but could eventually command upwards of $25 million a year. Springer is up for arbitration after this season, and he should get paid handsomely if he puts together a full season. They may as well just give Correa the deed to Minute Maid Park right now and save the hassle.\n\nThe point of this wide-ranging, future-salary talk is to point out that the Astros are in an enviable situation right now, in the moment, a situation in which they have several All-Star-level players at bargain salaries ready to win at a high level.

The calculator, called Calcflow, features intuitive ways for students to learn the foundations of vector calculus.\n\n“When you put on the headset, you can manipulate vectors with your hands, and explore vector addition and cross product,” said Nanome co-founder Keita Funakawa, who received a bachelor’s degree from UC San Diego in Management Science in 2016. “You can see and feel a double integral of a sinusoidal graph in 3D, a mobius strip and its normal, and spherical coordinates—even create your own parametrized function and vector field!”\n\nIf all of this sounds like another language to you, the calculator also features presets and sample problems, and allows users to take notes within the program.\n\nNano-one and Calcflow launched in the STEAM store (VR equivalent of an app story) Nov. 10, and are finalists for CONNECT’s Most Innovative New Product Awards in December.\n\nThe Making of a Company\n\nAt first, McCloskey thought about creating a video game to help nanoengineers visualize their research, but then he came across the Oculus Rift.\n\n“A lightbulb went off in my head,” he said. “I knew that the immersive environment VR creates was the future of nanoengineering.”\n\nAt the same time as McCloskey was toying around with the idea of VR as a tool for nanoengineering, Funakawa was innovating in another field.\n\nThe company plans on staying device agnostic with software supporting the HTC Vive, Oculus touch, and mobile platforms.\n\n“Film is my passion,” said Funakawa.", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

It’s a bit grim for 90 minutes when the Reds are grim, but you still find ways of enjoying it.\n\nSo at the minute, I’m enjoying things quite a lot. It’s fun, we’re winning, we look really good at football, we’ve scored nine goals in our first two home league games, won at Arsenal and Chelsea, and really do look like we’ll have a go at trying to win the title.

We play the cards we’re dealt.\n\nThat’s what I’m in football for anyway, I suspect it’s what plenty of people are in football for. But there are people who clearly aren’t. Being right on the internet is more important to them.

You see, being aggressively vocal is really important to these people.\n\nPersonally, I’ve watched him plenty of times this season and wish we’d not bothered signing him and instead have signed someone who can sit in front of the back four, run around loads, kick people and maybe pass the ball ten yards on occasion if he’s feeling adventurous. Or not, but these people do actually exist. I always suspect the vociferous internet lads don’t take as much pleasure in Liverpool scoring as the rest of us do because they long for being able to tell you that they told you so, and Mane looking every inch a £30m footballer doesn’t really help you.\n\nPersonally, I quite like being wrong.

That is wrong, that is unconscionable, and that has got to change,” wrote Sanders in response to IFPTE questions asking the candidates if they would work to ensure pay raises for feds and protect their pensions. “The fact of the matter is that no other worker has been asked to sacrifice more on the altar of deficit reduction than our federal workers.”\n\nFederal workers endured a three-year pay freeze between 2011 and 2013. They’ve received across-the-board pay raises of 1.3 percent in 2016, and 1 percent each in 2015 and 2014. All those boosts were below the percentage mandated by the formula in the 1990 Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. President Obama has proposed a 1.6 percent pay bump for 2017.\n\nClinton noted that her experience as secretary of State, New York senator, and First Lady have enabled her to witness “first-hand” federal employees’ contributions to the country. “I was serving as Secretary of State when federal salaries were frozen in 2011, and I saw how difficult it was for employees to be told that even though they were working hard and their living costs were going up, their paychecks were not,” Clinton wrote in response to the IFPTE questionnaire. “The government is not going to be able to recruit and retain the high-caliber employees it needs if it does not pay federal employees fairly for their work.”\n\nShe also said that it’s “unfair to require additional increases in retirement contributions as a backdoor pay-cut for federal workers,” and pledged her continued support for veterans’ preference in federal hiring, in response to a specific IFPTE question. As part of the 2013 budget deal, federal employees hired on or after Jan. 1, 2014, with less than five years of service have to pay 4.4 percent toward their pensions -- 1.3 percent more than employees hired after 2012 contribute to their defined retirement benefit, and 3.6 percent more than most workers hired in or before 2012 contribute. Republican lawmakers since then have offered other proposals -- so far, unsuccessful -- to further increase the amount all federal workers contribute to their pensions.\n\nBoth Democratic candidates, unsurprisingly, also vowed to preserve the right of workers to collectively bargain, and to renew Obama’s 2009 executive order", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

In a sense, it was like the icing on the cake for that album for me.\n\nAnd people can’t think of Sublime without visualizing that sun — you see it everywhere! That’s got to be a huge nod to you as an artist! People who love Sublime want it tattooed on them, they want the shirts, the lighters, they just want to embody all of that because it represents Sublime and you provided that visual presence…\n\nYea I think I just if it wasn’t me it probably would have been some other artist, you know what I mean?

I think we just started getting calls to play, so we just did a mini tour for Cali. I don’t know if it was just therapy for them or all of us, but we all came together and we kind of figured it out.

Outstanding product warranties were excluded from the acquisition terms, so it appears that Toshiba is only willing to cover the most necessary products, those being OCZ's most popular SSDs. Bear in mind that the acquisition only included OCZ's consumer and enterprise storage divisions -- last time I heard OCZ was looking for a buyer for its other units but it seems that they've not been able to find one.\n\nUpdate: OCZ told us that they have a buyer for their PSU business with more details to follow in two weeks. The RAM and cooling divisions have been discontinued a long while ago, though.\n\nNormal Support Support Until Jan 22, 2015 Not Supported Vector 150 Vector Vertex 460 Vertex 450 Vertex 4 Vertex 3 Vertex 2 Vertex RevoDrive RevoDrive 3 RevoDrive 3X2 Agility 4 Agility 3 Agility 2 Agility ALL Non-SSD Products Core Series Apex Petrol Octane Series Solid Series Colossus Series IBIS Enyo Nocti RevoDrive Hybrid Summit Synapse Onyx Series Solid Series OCZ SATA I SSD (1st gen) OCZ SATA II SSD (1st gen)\n\nThe good news is that the most popular SSDs are covered, including the older members of the Vertex family. The Agility series will be supported for another year, meaning that some warranties of Agility 3 and 4 will be shortened. Unsupported products include the rest of OCZ's SSDs and most of these are models that were never even sampled to media. Ultimately I believe these products were also OCZ's stumbling blocks because although they were cheap, the performance was horrible and failure rates were ridiculously high.\n\nIf you have an unsupported product, you may not be out of luck if you happen to live in EU or other region with strict consumer protection laws.

The more and the better you give, the more and the better you will receive.\n\nFiles are shared with PNF Software (they are not shared directly with other users);\n\nContributions and users are algorithmically ranked and scored;\n\nIn exchange for their contributions, users receive more files, based on their score.\n\nThe goal is to offer a platform for reversers that can (and wish to) share malware files to easily do it, with the added incentive of receiving samples in return — including relatively high-value files that may not be accessible to most users, such as files that are not publicly downloadable on most malware trackers; or files that are not present on malware databases at all, including VirusTotal.\n\nObviously, the service is entirely optional. Any user, including users of the demo version, may use it whenever they please.\n\nGetting started\n\nThe latest JEB update will let you know about the Malware Sharing Network right after you upgrade. You may also click the Share button in the toolbar at any time to get started.\n\nFirst time users should create an account. You will only need an email address and a password. Click the “Create an Account” button to sign up.\n\nOnce you’ve successfully logged in, you will be able to view your profile. Things like your sharing score and other stats are displayed.\n\nSharing a File\n\nAny time you are working in JEB, you can decide to share the primary file being worked on by clicking the Share button or the Share entry in the File menu:\n\nBefore sharing a file, you may:\n\nredact the sample name;\n\nadd a text comment;\n\nselect a Determination, among four choices (“Unknown”, “Clean”, “Unsure” and “Malicious”).\n\nBy hitting the Share button, you will submit the file to PNF Software. It will be added to our file portal, get scored, and eventually, be shared with other users who are participating in this sample exchange program.\n\nWhen your score gets high enough, you will receive samples.

More than 600 books have been written on this national tragedy and yet the implausible explanations the Warren Commission report put forward remain as the official story. We’re joined today by Zachary Sklar to discuss some of those challenges and his work investigating those involved in the planning and covering up of assassinations.\n\nZach Sklar:\n\nThe Warren Commission was a creature appointed by Lyndon Johnson.\n\nHe persuaded Earl Warren to head this commission against his wishes. He was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at the time.\n\nTo bolster him on the commission, the one who did most of the work and guided the findings was Alan Dulles, former CIA directory. A man who’d been fired by John Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs invasion.\n\nThe other one who was on it was Gerald Ford of course.\n\nSo, there was a dissenting group of southern Congress people who really didn’t have much power. Ultimately, the power was with Alan Dulles.\n\nThe CIA had overthrown Mossadegh in Iran, Arbenz in Guatemala, not only overthrowing governments but assassinating leaders.\n\nThe commission report – that conclusion was decided upon and then they had to come up with some reasons to support it.\n\nThe reasons were designed by Arlen Specter. He was a staff lawyer at the time and later a Senator from Pennsylvania. He came up with the Magic Bullet Theory .\n\n. Because the Zapruder film came out with the time frame of 5.62 seconds and there were 3 bullets during that time frame, all the wounds in John Kennedy and John Connelly.\n\nLee Oswald was given a paraffin test the day of his arrest. It was negative. It had proven he’d not fired a rifle that day.\n\nAccording to the Marines, Oswald was a mediocre marksman at best.\n\nThe rifle that he was supposed to have used. . . if you ask any rifle dealer what the worst rifle, the least accurate rifle you could ever come up with they would tell you its the Mannlicher-Carcano. It’s called the humanitarian rifle by the Italians.\n\nAll this should’ve been put to rest in 1979 when the House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated and came up with acoustical evidence from a", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_4_449", "config_id": 4, "prompt": " two levels of challenge in these sections. Basic traversal is one — Faith must find a way to a platform through multiple levels of the very complicated catwalks and geometry of a server room not designed for human egress. This is Mirror's Edge 101 stuff, but it never stopped feeling cool.\n\nBut there's a second, optional mechanic in play in grid node sections, as security lasers are strategically placed throughout each environment. Crossing a beam sets off a security alert, which is generally not a thing you should be doing, though you won't instantly fail for screwing up. If you're like me, however, you will feel pretty badass threading jumps and slides and wall-runs just so, like some kind of parkour cat burglar.\n\nMirror's Edge Catalyst can display a strange lack of confidence in its best self\n\nOnly one of these missions is critical to finishing the game. The rest are optional tasks that open up fast travel options throughout Glass. And I'll be honest: This seems like a colossal waste. I'd have much rather gone through more and more intricate future heists than have had to beat up another room full of security forces using combat mechanics that still aren't very fun.\n\nThe City of Glass' security forces are usually nonlethally armed. Security officers with guns have advanced weapons that can only be used by their owner. Now let that breath out, because DICE still falls prey to far too frequent combat encounters that try to squeeze more out of Catalyst's fighting system than it's really capable of. Faith's martial arts prowess is absent the fluidity and grace of her high-speed navigation through the environment, and it feels frustratingly clunky by comparison.\n\nI didn't particularly enjoy the combat in Mirror's Edge Catalyst, but there is at least a sense of satisfaction to the crunch of a roundhouse kick connecting with the helmet of a K-Sec officer. I felt a grim kind of accomplishment at beating the more elite troops every now and again.\n\nBut K-Sec and fistfights seem to be Mirror's Edge Catalyst's crutch when it can't think of anything else to do. Too many levels end with boring physical encounters; the last quarter of the game especially suffers from this, falling prey to standard action game conventions. Enemies that served as bosses appear in regular groups of enemies, and then there are two heavies. \"Screw it,\" I imagine someone said — \"let's just literally have a slapstick moment where Faith comes around", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "wikitext103", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

(Suda calls the look a \"hyper-contrast shader,\" which he wants people to think of as the game's calling card.)\n\n\"I keep striving for something new that people have never seen. I don't want it to have a certain name, like a comic-like look or a type of formalism,\" Suda says about an approach seen before in Killer 7 and No More Heroes. \"From a digital art perspective, I'm trying to capture something that's happening in real life, but not in the regular sense that people imagine - [I want] to describe it in a different way.\"\n\nKiller is Dead finds a brilliant middle ground between Killer 7 and No More Heroes.\n\nKiller is Dead is spread out like a television drama across a succession of episodes following executioner-by-trade Mondo Zappa. He's an amalgamation of Killer 7's cold-blooded Dan Smith and Flower, Sun and Rain's detective-like \"searcher\" Sumio Mondo, and in our brief demo he's just ascended to the top of a corporate tower where his mark is waiting for him.\n\nThere follows a boss battle between Mondo and the ghoulish Victor, a corpse who's sporting frilly Victorian garb and recording headphones, and who's drawn from the Suda 51 casting book of insane villains. Victor has the ability to steal sound from his victims and plans to use it to destroy the world - not that Mondo can hear anything the old corpse says until he puts on his own pair of solid gold cans.\n\nWhen the battle proper starts, Victor sheds his weak form for a much more powerful one, sporting a weird cybernetic suit whose massive arms extend like limber sinew. Combat looks similar to No More Heroes in that Mondo's primary tool is a katana, though there's some gunplay thrown in for good measure by way of the executioner's transforming cybernetic arm.\n\nAlthough the nuts and bolts gameplay seem relatively straightforward, the artistic flourishes throughout the fast-paced battle are mesmerising. Mondo's blade leaves an electric trail of neon blue as it bites through the air, while Victor's hulking arms bathe the screen in fuchsia tones.

(The initial date had to be postponed due to severe weather.)\n\nClifford V. Johnson is a theoretical physicist passionate about sharing science with the public. He resolved to write a book explaining physics to a lay audience, but he felt that words on a printed page did not fully convey the dynamic, collaborative nature of fundamental research.\n\nWhat if, he wondered, you could represent multiple voices and points of view? What if one could make the reader feel immersed in scientific discourse, rather than reading the words of an expert sharing a single perspective?\n\nHe wanted to write a book that would give readers a fly-on-the-wall experience of the process of fundamental science. Johnson realized that graphic novels are the unique narrative medium he was searching for. Through the written word and compelling visuals, graphic novels immerse the reader in a sensory world of ideas.\n\nThis realization led Johnson to write and draw The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of the Universe (MIT Press), which allows readers to eavesdrop on a series of dialogues, set in locations around the world, about cutting-edge scientific topics.\n\nIn his public lecture webcast at Perimeter on February 6 February 7, Johnson will discuss the process of turning complex scientific topics into compelling visual narratives. The talk will be “graphic,” but in a family-friendly way.\n\nClifford V. Johnson’s work in science ranges from teaching and research into black holes, particle physics, string theory, and cosmology, to public outreach where he strives to put science back into the general culture. He helps artists, writers, and filmmakers incorporate science into their work, and appears on several TV and online shows. He has been a science advisor for many TV shows and movies, including Nat Geo’s Genius (featuring Einstein), Marvel’s Agent Carter, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, and more.\n\nTickets to attend this lecture in person will be available here on Monday, January 21 at 9 am ET.Watch the live webcast on this page on Wednesday, February 6, 2019 Thursday, February 7 at 7 pm ET.

In general, the less you use the better; however, there are times where using a small amount of work is less likely to be fair use. If you use the key moment of a work (like re-posting the minute of American Idol where they announce the winner), do not transform it, and post it by itself it is far less likely to be fair use. Factor 4 The fourth factor looks determines if your video is a market replacement for the video. For example, if you re-posted a music video on your channel your re-post is a direct replacement for the original, it is less likely to be fair use.\n\nTF: Do you think there are positives to the ContentID system? If so, what are they?\n\nTK: The general idea behind ContentID is good; the main problem is in the execution. If ContentID was nothing more than an easy way for creators to be compensated and negotiate actual licenses when their work is reused improperly, that might be OK. But ContentID simply doesn’t work like that.\n\nTF: If you could change the ContentID system, how would you revise it?\n\nTK: If I could revise ContentID, I would make two changes. First, I would make ContentID effectively account for fair use. Currently, ContentID has a very difficult time separating out fair use from infringing use of a copyrighted work.\n\nThe vast majority of the ContentID cases we see at New Media Rights involve works that should not have been flagged because they constitute fair use. While we sympathize that it is challenging to develop a computer algorithm that can tag fair use, we are particularly worried that content owners can financially benefit from and otherwise control creative work of those who utilize legal uses of copyrighted content. Forcing works to be monetized is particularly troublesome for artists who are directly criticizing or parodying the original work.\n\nSecondly, I’d make the appeals process easier. The average user and the average large content holders do not understand the appeals process because it isn’t terribly straight forward.\n\nEven if the user understands it, the process can quite intimidating. For example, the simple concept of requiring users to enter a telephone number in order to appeal a claim scares some users out of filing an appeal. In addition, the appeals process for fair use asks users to address each of the fair use factors in detail, something that can only properly be done by an experienced attorney, and discour", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

The Radio Industrial Complex hadn't fully kicked into gear - regional stations hadn't been gobbled whole by centralised conglomerates - and the Madchester scene had proved that local areas could flourish on a national stage if given the exposure. And so it proved, if a band from Downpatrick could conquer the Belfast scene, they could find themselves leading the soundtrack to a Hollywood movie starring Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz.For a while in the mid nineties, the charts were flooded with music from across the country that straddled genres from the burgeoning rave/trip hop/house end of the spectrum to Uk hip hop finding it's feet with Mark Morrison, and the album charts awash with records that were recorded in every country of the islands.Eventually the things ran their natural course, tastes moved on, output from reliable artists veered into the middle of the road, Napster ambushed the business model of an entire industry that refused to embrace the future, 9/11 triggered a diktat that coursed through American radio that implied music was a source of evil, and reality television delivered manufactured music to the masses cheaper, quicker and more reliably than ever before.So Britpop became a memory, one which has very selectively been shrunk to a Big Four - Oasis, Blur, Pulp and Suede. To narrow one of the most expansive periods in music to four bands is woefully reductive, but what of the Four that were deemed Big. Oasis and Blur were unquestionably the two biggest acts of the era, with their chart battles becoming the stuff of legend , and few bands personified the propulsion of regional music better than Jarvis Cocker's Pulp, who had spent years in Sheffield clubs before hitting the big time.But Suede? How did they get elevated to this bracket? Yes they had hits, and a massive album, but so did lots of bands. Why not Supergrass, with their records of wall-to-wall hits? Why not Manic Street Preachers, who managed some of the most subversive Number 1 hits in chart history (how many other ones were about the Spanish Civil War )? Why not Ocean Colour Scene?Was it their alternative credentials? They why not Placebo, or Elastica, or Skunk Anansie? Their pop song-writing sensibilities?

There are some steps you should take before you ever buy any reptile from an online source, and this is true whether you want to buy chameleons for sale or another type of lizard. Online purchasing means that the animal must be shipped to you, and if the animal is not in excellent health or the shipping is not handled properly then you could end up buying lizards for sale which may die or become ill after you receive them.\n\nIf you are searching for bearded dragons as pets or you want to find an iguana you may not be able to go to your local pet store. Many stores do not specialize in lizards and other reptiles, and in some cases it may be necessary to buy lizards for sale online instead. The best option is to use a reputable breeder, one who has been in business for a while and has a reputation for healthy high quality reptiles. Online purchases means that the animal must be shipped, and this is normally done using FEDEX since UPS no longer allows for the shipment of pet geckos for sale or other live reptiles.\n\nFinding online lizards for sale is easy, but you will want to make sure your reptile stays comfortable and has as little stress as possible during the shipping process. Experienced reptile suppliers who provide live shipping in the cooler months will usually add some hand warmers to the package, to keep the lizard warm and prevent any health problems. Check out the breeder you use carefully, and ask questions to ensure you are getting the healthiest reptile possible. Most breeders specialize in certain species, and this can give you reassurance. A good tip is to ask about the care of your animal before making the purchase. A water dragon breeder who can not explain water dragon care is probably not the best choice. The breeder should know all about caring for the reptiles offered, and if they do not this can be a sign that you should find another breeder instead.There are many types of lizards for sale online, but what should you watch for when you buy these animals using the Internet?

But a new investigative report by Reuters found 1,005 cases in the United States where a person died after police used the weapon on them.\n\nThe news outlet also found autopsy reports for 712 of the cases. In 153 of those autopsies, stun guns were cited as a cause of or contributing factor to the death. The majority of the rest of the autopsies “cited a combination of heart and medical conditions, drug use and various forms of trauma,” according to Reuters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout a quarter of those killed were suffering from a neurological disorder or mental health issues. Most of the people were unarmed.\n\nTasers first became popular among police officers in the early 2000s. Around that time, the company claimed the device could help officers take control of people who are intoxicated or in the midst of a mental breakdown, Reuters reported, highlighting a 2007 deposition in which Taser President Rick Smith said,“We did see those as potential uses of the device,” as well as 2004 police-training material calling stun guns the “premier tool” for agencies that work with“emotionally disturbed persons.”\n\nTaser International changed its name to Axon earlier this year, as it began a program to give free body cameras to all police officers in the country for a year. Today, about 90 percent of police agencies use Tasers. The weapons are often promoted as a safer alternative to guns, largely thanks to studies like a 2011 US Department of Justice report showing Tasers lower injury rates when used properly. Last year, the company debuted a small Taser gun for consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Tuttle, Axon’s vice president of communications, told Gizmodo that since there are hundreds of reports, abstracts, and studies on the Taser, it is the “most-studied less-lethal weapon” available to law enforcement officers. “Tasers are not risk free but they are proven safer than batons, fists, take downs, tackles, and impact munitions,” said Tuttle. “Any loss of life is a tragedy regardless of the circumstance, which is why we remain committed to developing technology and training to protect life in public safety.”\n\nAxon told Reuters that their report is misleading because most of the deaths also involved police force and because the autopsies had not been", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

Autonomous drones would not have the sensibility of a pilot for constantly varying flight situations.

The imaging capabilities of drones are mighty impressive.\n\nYes, drones might \"enhance the public's understanding of events.\" And, true, drones may well have been \"used to capture footage of massive demonstrations in Ukraine.\" (Indeed, drones are ideal for identifying and monitoring demonstrators.)\n\nHowever, your May 11 editorial, \"Journalists have right to use drones, too,\" under analyzed the issue. Sure, news corporations may seek to automate where they can. But working journalists and photographers probably value the right to be gainfully employed and not be replaced by those robots.\n\nYour editorial criticized the FAA for not licensing news corporations to use drones. But it failed to cite the safety concerns around drones that, given the current regulatory vacuum, the FAA must wrestle with. Or, to enhance the public's understanding, your editorial might have addressed drone-related privacy and civil liberties issues. These are local, national and international.\n\nSeveral months ago our own Common Council wisely and unanimously passed a resolution banning drones over Syracuse absent adequate regulation. Six states even restrict drone use by law enforcement.\n\nOn May 9 the Wall Street Journal reported that this past March a U.S. passenger jet nearly collided with a drone over Florida - a disturbing news item, which as far as I know, the Post-Standard didn't publish.\n\nMy hope is that your parent company's eagerness to embrace the drone won't lead you to sidestep covering drone problems.

It voted 9 to 3 that the health insurer acted in bad faith by refusing to pay for the out-of-state operation. The panel deliberated for less than two days.\n\nBlue Cross approved Nehme's liver transplant in late 2006, and he was on the waiting list at UCLA Medical Center. But the company refused to pay when Nehme, gravely ill and fearing for his life, decided to have the operation in Indiana, where wait times are far shorter than in California.\n\nIn addition, the jury ordered Blue Cross to pay plaintiff Ephram Nehme's legal expenses, which could dwarf the $206,000 cost of the transplant.\n\nA Los Angeles jury concluded Monday that Anthem Blue Cross should cover the cost of an out-of-state liver transplant that a California man paid for after the insurer balked.\n\n\"The message here is that you can't take people's money, promise to protect them, and then leave them to die in their time of need,\" said Nehme's lawyer, Scott Glovsky.\n\nAt a hearing set for next week, Glovsky said he would seek to broaden the jury's verdict under the state's unfair competition law. He will ask Superior Court Judge Kenneth Freeman to order Blue Cross to allow its California members to pursue organ transplants at hospitals nationwide that do business with its parent, Indianapolis-based WellPoint Inc., the nation's largest health insurer.\n\nIn a statement, Blue Cross acknowledged \"the jury's determination that Mr. Nehme's transplant should have been approved by Anthem Blue Cross despite the fact that Mr. Nehme's Anthem Blue Cross contract states that transplants must be performed only at California Centers of Excellence.\"\n\n\"While we disagree with the jury's coverage determination, we are pleased that the jury did not award punitive damages and unanimously concluded that Anthem Blue Cross did not act with any malice toward Mr. Nehme,\" the company said.\n\nA spokeswoman said the company had not decided whether it would appeal.\n\nBlue Cross also said it offered to settle the case with Nehme several months ago for more money than the jury awarded.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the time spent by the jury and the considerable costs of this trial could have been avoided,\" the company said in its statement.\n\nNehme, a 62-year-old produce merchant and grandfather, said the case was not about", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}

{"id": "sample_4_497", "config_id": 4, "prompt": " is no surprise. The Altair team have been poring over the old design blueprints and have even drafted in some of the old Apollo engineers. \"We ask them a lot of questions,\" said Mr Connolly. Even the lander's name has echoes of the Eagle. Altair is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila, Latin for Eagle. Compare the two landers But there are also key differences. For starters, the new craft is much larger and is a multi-role vehicle, able to deliver astronauts or cargo to the Moon's surface. In a standard mission, it will be able to deliver four astronauts to the lunar surface, compared with the Eagle's two. Altair has been designed as a multi-use vehicle The module acts as living quarters for the crew and features an airlock, meaning that the whole cabin does not need to be depressurised every time an astronaut exits the vehicle. It also has an additional advantage. \"We talked to the Apollo astronauts and they had a real problem with dust in the cabin,\" said Mr Connolly. \"The airlock allows us control the dust - dusty space suits can be kept out of the cabin - and it also allows us to split the crew's operations.\" In the new lander, for example, two astronauts could remain inside whilst two others explore outside. The airlock - because of its weight - is left behind on the Moon's surface with the descent stage when the astronauts are ready to leave. Other configurations of the new lander allow it to act as a lunar outpost, sustaining a crew for more than six months, or as a cargo truck, shipping more than 14 tonnes of material to the surface. These option are critical for Nasa's plans to set up a base on the moon as a staging post for exploration on Mars. The design margins for Eagle were very thin\n\nJohn Connolly All the vehicles use a common descent stage, with different configurations of craft on top depending on the mission. However, one of the main differences to Eagle is the craft's ability to land almost anywhere on the lunar surface. \"Apollo was restricted to mid latitudes and broad daylight,\" explained Justin Vican, part of a team at the Draper Laboratory in Boston, US, which is developing a new landing system for Altair. \"They could only land under optimal conditions.\" Looking down The Autonomous precision Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (Alhat) project at Draper Labs - the place where the first Apollo Guidance Computers were designed - aims to overcome these limitations.", "prompt_length": 512, "generation_length": 32, "source_type": "synthetic", "metadata": {"created_at": "2025-05-30", "tokenizer": "gpt2", "prompt_tokens": 512}}
